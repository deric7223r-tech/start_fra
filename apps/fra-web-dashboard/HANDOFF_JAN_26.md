## 2. Environment Configuration

### Current Setup
The project uses Supabase for backend services. Environment variables are configured in `.env`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=aekheoxxnbuaxgpzisgk
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://aekheoxxnbuaxgpzisgk.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[configured]
```

### Required Environment Variables
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Important Notes
- ⚠️ `.env` file is NOT in `.gitignore` - ensure sensitive credentials are protected
- Separate credentials needed for dev/staging/production environments
- Supabase project access must be granted to jan_26 team

---

## 3. Build & Deployment Status

### ✅ Production Build: SUCCESSFUL
```bash
npm run build
```

---

## 6. Compliance & Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Requirements
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ ARIA labels on interactive elements
- ⚠️ Requires accessibility testing across:
  - Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
  - Keyboard-only navigation
  - Color contrast verification
  - Focus indicators

### British English
- ✅ UK spelling throughout (organisation, colour, defence)
- ✅ Professional government tone maintained

### Security Considerations
- ✅ Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Authentication via Supabase Auth
- ⚠️ XSS prevention - review React Router vulnerability
- ⚠️ Input sanitization - verify all user inputs

## SLIDE 2: Opening & Context
 
### Title
**"The Failure to Prevent Fraud Offence: What You Need to Know"**
 
### Visual Design


## Page 3

**Left Column (50%):** Large icon or graphic representing law/compliance
**Right Column (50%):** Key facts
 
### Content
 
**The New Landscape:**
 
 **Effective:** September 2025
 
 **Source:** Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023
 
 **Target:** Organisations, not just individuals
 
 **Penalty:** Unlimited fines + director disqualification + reputational 
damage
 
---
 
**What Changed?**
 
Before: Only individuals prosecuted for fraud
Now: Organisations criminally liable if fraud committed "for their benefit"
 
---


## Page 4

 
**The Critical Point:**
Your organisation can be convicted even if:
- Senior leadership had no knowledge
- Robust policies existed on paper
- It was one rogue employee
 
**Unless:** You can prove reasonable prevention procedures were in place
 
### Speaker Notes
- Emphasize paradigm shift: organisational accountability
- Ask: "How many have reviewed fraud risk in past 12 months?"
- Note: This isn't just compliance theatre; it's existential risk management
- September 2025 is closer than it appears—action needed now
 
---
 
## SLIDE 3: Who This Applies To
 
### Title
**"Is Your Organisation in Scope?"**
 
### Visual Design


## Page 5

**Center:** Qualification criteria in visual checklist format
**Bottom:** Warning banner
 
### Content
 
**Large Organisation Criteria**
(Must meet 2 of 3):
 
✓ Annual turnover > £36 million
✓ Balance sheet total > £18 million
✓ 250+ employees
 
---
 
**BUT WAIT...**
 
 Even if you're below these thresholds:
 
- Fraud committed "for your benefit" = you're liable
- Insurers expect fraud risk management
- Regulators scrutinize governance
- Stakeholders demand transparency
- **Best practice applies to ALL organisations**


## Page 6

 
---
 
**Key Question:**
"Can we afford NOT to manage fraud risk systematically?"
 
### Speaker Notes
- Many attendees may assume they're too small to be affected
- Emphasize: Fraud doesn't discriminate by organization size
- Even small charities, SMEs face significant fraud risks
- Regulatory expectations evolving across all sectors
 
---
 
## SLIDE 4: Understanding Fraud - The Triangle Model
 
### Title
**"What Constitutes Fraud? The Three Elements"**
 
### Visual Design
**Center:** Triangle graphic with three labeled corners
**Surrounding:** Examples for each element
 


## Page 7

### Content
 
```
        PRESSURE/MOTIVATION
        • Financial stress
        • Unrealistic targets
        • Personal crisis
               /\
              /  \
             /    \
            /      \
           /        \
          /          \
         /            \
        /______________\
OPPORTUNITY          RATIONALIZATION
• Weak controls      • "Everyone does it"
• Lack of oversight  • "I deserve this"
• Access to assets   • "Just borrowing"
```
 
---
 


## Page 8

**Common Fraud Types in Your Organisation:**
 
 **Procurement:** Fake suppliers, kickbacks, bid rigging
 
 **Payroll:** Ghost employees, timesheet manipulation
 
 **Revenue:** Sales inflation, premature recognition
 
 **Expenses:** False claims, personal use of funds
 
 **Cyber:** Email impersonation, invoice fraud
 
### Speaker Notes
- Fraud is NOT committed by obvious criminals
- Often long-serving, trusted employees under pressure
- All three elements must be present—eliminate one, prevent fraud
- Most effective: Remove OPPORTUNITY through controls
 
---
 
## SLIDE 5: The Defence - Reasonable Procedures
 
### Title


## Page 9

**"Your Legal Shield: Reasonable Prevention Procedures"**
 
### Visual Design
**Left:** Shield icon with "Reasonable Procedures" text
**Right:** Six principles as numbered list
 
### Content
 
**The ONLY Defence:**
Prove you had **reasonable procedures** to prevent fraud
 
---
 
**Six Principles (GovS-013 Framework):**
 
 **Top-level commitment**
   Tone from the top—board demonstrates zero tolerance
 
 **Risk assessment**
   Systematic identification of fraud risks
 
 **Proportionate procedures**
   Controls matched to your risk profile


## Page 10

 
 **Due diligence**
   Third-party vetting (suppliers, partners)
 
 **Communication & training**
   Awareness at all levels of organisation
 
 **Monitoring & review**
   Continuous improvement, not one-off exercise
 
---
 
**"Reasonable" ≠ Perfect**
It means: Proportionate, documented, regularly reviewed
 
### Speaker Notes
- These principles are your roadmap
- GovS-013 is government standard but applies beyond public sector
- Courts will assess "reasonableness" based on your size, sector, risk profile
- Documentation is critical—can you prove what you did?

## SLIDE 6: Financial & Reputational Consequences
 
### Title
**"The True Cost of Fraud"**
 
### Visual Design
**Two columns:** Direct Costs | Indirect Costs
**Bottom:** Case study highlight box
 
### Content
 
**Direct Costs**
 
 **Average fraud loss:**
   5% of annual revenue (ACFE 2024)
 
 **Investigation costs:**
   Legal fees, forensic accounting
 
 **Regulatory fines:**
   Unlimited under new offence
 
---


## Page 12

 
**Indirect Costs**
 
 **Reputational damage**
   Customer/donor trust erosion
 
 **Insurance premiums**
   Increased costs, reduced coverage
 
 **Lost contracts**
   Partners exit relationships
 
 **Employee morale**
   Culture of distrust
 
 **Director disqualification**
   Personal consequences for leadership
 
---
 
**Case Study:**
NHS Trust procurement fraud
- £1.2M loss over 3 years


## Page 13

- £400K investigation costs
- CEO resignation
- 18 months to restore stakeholder confidence
 
### Speaker Notes
- 5% revenue loss = £1.8M for £36M turnover organisation
- Reputational damage often exceeds direct financial loss
- Ask: "What would fraud scandal mean for OUR organisation?"
- Emphasize: Prevention cheaper than cure
 
---
 
## SLIDE 7: Board & Leadership Responsibilities
 
### Title
**"What Leadership Must Own"**
 
### Visual Design
**Top:** Five non-delegable duties as icons
**Bottom:** Red flag checklist
 
### Content
 


## Page 14

**Non-Delegable Duties**
 
 **Approve fraud risk strategy**
   Board-level ownership and oversight
 
 **Allocate adequate resources**
   Budget for prevention, detection, response
 
 **Set the tone**
   Model ethical behavior consistently
 
 **Receive regular reports**
   Fraud risk on board agenda (minimum quarterly)
 
 **Challenge & scrutinize**
   Ask difficult questions, don't accept platitudes
 
---
 
**
 Red Flags of Governance Failure:**
 
 No fraud risk on board agenda in past 12 months
 No designated fraud risk owner


## Page 15

 Fraud response plan doesn't exist or untested
 No training for budget-holders or procurement staff
 Whistleblowing policy not publicized to staff
 
---
 
**Critical Question:**
"When did our board last receive a comprehensive fraud risk report?"
 
### Speaker Notes
- These are leadership responsibilities—cannot delegate to operational teams
- Board owns the strategy; management executes
- If you can't answer "when we last reviewed fraud risk," that's a red flag
- Interactive: Ask attendees to self-assess against red flags
 
---
 
## SLIDE 8: Budget-Holder Accountability
 
### Title
**"Budget-Holders: You Are the Front Line"**
 
### Visual Design


## Page 16

**Center:** Four-quadrant graphic showing fraud scenarios
**Border:** "Your Obligations" footer
 
### Content
 
**Why Budget-Holders Are Critical:**
You control spending, approve transactions, manage supplier/staff relationships
 
---
 
**Common Fraud Scenarios:**
 
 **Procurement Fraud**
- Split purchases to avoid approval thresholds
- Sole-sourcing without justification
- Conflicts of interest (family/friend suppliers)
 
 **Invoice Fraud**
- Fake supplier invoices
- Inflated pricing, duplicate payments
- Bank account change requests (impersonation)
 
 **Payroll Manipulation**


## Page 17

- Ghost employees on payroll
- Unauthorized overtime claims
- Inappropriate use of temp staff budgets
 
 **Expense Abuse**
- Personal expenses claimed as business
- Inflated mileage/subsistence claims
 
---
 
**Your Obligations:**
 
✓ Know your delegated authority limits
✓ Question unusual requests
✓ Follow procurement procedures (no shortcuts)
✓ Report suspicions immediately (not tomorrow, NOW)
 
---
 
**Scenario Exercise:**
"A trusted 10-year supplier emails: 'Urgent—update bank details for payment.' 
What do you do?"
 
### Speaker Notes


## Page 18

- Budget-holders often feel pressure to "make things happen quickly"
- Shortcuts create opportunities for fraud
- **Scenario answer:** STOP. Call supplier using known phone number. Verify 
request. Email impersonation is #1 fraud vector.
- Emphasize: You won't be penalized for questioning suspicious requests
 
---
 
## SLIDE 9: Conducting a Fraud Risk Assessment
 
### Title
**"Starting Your Fraud Risk Assessment Journey"**
 
### Visual Design
**Left column:** 5-step process flowchart
**Right column:** Timeline and tools
 
### Content
 
**Step-by-Step Process:**
 
**1. Identify fraud risk areas**
   Where could fraud occur in our operations?
 


## Page 19

**2. Assess inherent risk**
   Impact × Likelihood (without controls)
 
**3. Review existing controls**
   What prevents/detects fraud now?
 
**4. Calculate residual risk**
   Risk remaining after controls applied
 
**5. Prioritize gaps**
   Focus resources on high-residual risks
 
---
 
**Time Required:**
 
 Small organisation: 2-4 weeks
 Medium/large organisation: 6-8 weeks
 
---
 
**Tools Available:**
 


## Page 20

 **Stop FRA platform**
   Automated, GovS-013 aligned, generates reports
 
 **Internal audit-led assessment**
   Leverage existing assurance function
 
 **External consultant support**
   Specialist fraud risk advisors
 
---
 
**Key Message:**
"You don't need perfection on day one. Start with basic assessment and 
iterate."
 
### Speaker Notes
- Assessment is foundation of reasonable procedures
- Can't manage what you haven't measured
- Stop FRA automates much of this—13 comprehensive modules
- Question: "Who here has budget responsibility for risk assessment?"
 
---
 
## SLIDE 10: Implementation Roadmap


## Page 21

 
### Title
**"From Assessment to Action: Your 90-Day Plan"**
 
### Visual Design
**Four-phase timeline** with checkboxes
 
### Content
 
**Phase 1: Weeks 1-4 (Foundation)**
- [ ] Board resolution: Commit to fraud risk management
- [ ] Appoint fraud risk owner (CFO, COO, Head of Governance)
- [ ] Budget allocation for assessment & controls
- [ ] Communicate commitment to all staff
 
---
 
**Phase 2: Weeks 5-8 (Assessment)**
- [ ] Conduct fraud risk assessment (Stop FRA or similar)
- [ ] Identify top 5-10 priority risks
- [ ] Review existing policies (whistleblowing, gifts, procurement)
- [ ] Gap analysis of current controls
 


## Page 22

---
 
**Phase 3: Weeks 9-12 (Action)**
- [ ] Draft/update fraud response plan
- [ ] Implement priority control improvements
- [ ] Schedule mandatory training (budget-holders first)
- [ ] Establish quarterly board reporting schedule
 
---
 
**Phase 4: Ongoing (Embed)**
- [ ] Annual fraud risk assessment refresh
- [ ] Bi-annual training updates
- [ ] Incident monitoring & reporting
- [ ] Independent assurance (audit review)
 
---
 
**Critical Path:**
Foundation → Assessment → Action → Embed
 
### Speaker Notes
- 90 days to operational baseline—ambitious but achievable


## Page 23

- Phase 1 is leadership commitment—without this, rest fails
- Phase 4 is continuous—fraud risk management never "finished"
- Stop FRA packages align with these phases
 
---

## OPTIONAL SLIDE 13: Live Fraud Scenario Exercise
 
### Title
**"Test Your Fraud Radar: Live Scenario"**
 
### Visual Design
**Top:** Scenario description box
**Bottom:** Group discussion prompts
 
### Content
 
**Scenario:**
 
Your Finance Manager of 8 years approaches you:
 
"We have an urgent payment due to a new IT supplier—£15,000 for 
cybersecurity software. The supplier needs payment today to maintain our 
license. I've checked them out; they're legitimate. Can you approve this as an 
exception to our normal procurement process? The vendor form is here."
 
**What do you do?**


## Page 29

 
---
 
**Breakout Discussion (5 minutes):**
 
1. What are the red flags?
2. What controls should exist to prevent this?
3. What's your immediate action?
 
---
 
**Debrief:**
 
**Red Flags:**
- Urgency ("needs payment today")
- New supplier (no due diligence)
- Exception to process
- Unusual request from trusted employee
 
**Controls:**
- Segregation of duties (approval ≠ requestor)
- Supplier verification process
- No exceptions to procurement policy


## Page 30

- Two-person approval for new suppliers
 
**Immediate Action:**
- STOP the payment
- Verify supplier independently (not via provided info)
- Check if software actually requested/needed
- Follow standard process—no shortcuts
 
---
 
**Real-World Outcome:**
This was an attempted invoice fraud. The "supplier" was fake. The Finance 
Manager's email had been compromised (spoofing attack). Organisation lost £0 
because they followed procedures.
 
### Speaker Notes
- Only use if time permits (15-minute extension)
- Encourage active participation from all attendees
- Emphasize: Pressure to bypass controls is key fraud indicator
- Ask: "Would your team have caught this?"
 
---
 
## OPTIONAL SLIDE 14: Whistleblowing Deep Dive


## Page 31

 
### Title
**"Speak Up Culture: Your First Line of Defense"**
 
### Visual Design
**Center:** Statistics graphic
**Bottom:** Checklist for effective whistleblowing
 
### Content
 
**The Evidence:**
 
 **40% of fraud detected via whistleblowing** (ACFE 2024)
 **2x more likely to detect fraud** with formal hotline
 **Median loss 50% lower** when whistleblowing effective
 
---
 
**What Makes Whistleblowing Effective?**
 
 **Multiple channels**
   Hotline, email, in-person, web portal
 


## Page 32

 **Anonymous option**
   Remove fear of retaliation
 
 **Visible promotion**
   Staff know it exists and how to use it
 
 **Protected disclosures**
   Clear policy: no retaliation tolerated
 
 **Timely action**
   Reports investigated promptly, outcomes communicated
 
 **Board oversight**
   Quarterly report on whistleblowing activity
 
---
 
**Self-Assessment:**
 
When did you last:
- Review your whistleblowing policy?
- Communicate it to all staff?
- Investigate a whistleblowing report?


## Page 33

- Report whistleblowing metrics to the board?
 
**If answers are "I don't know" or "Never"—you have a gap.**
 
### Speaker Notes
- Whistleblowing is early warning system
- Employees often see fraud indicators before management
- Fear of retaliation is biggest barrier—must be eliminated
- Ask: "How many staff could describe our whistleblowing process right now?"
 
---
 
## OPTIONAL SLIDE 15: Cyber Fraud Focus
 
### Title
**"Cyber Fraud: The Fastest-Growing Threat"**
 
### Visual Design
**Three-panel layout:** Email Impersonation | Ransomware | IT Controls
 
### Content
 
**Email Impersonation (Invoice Fraud)**


## Page 34

 
 **How it works:**
- Fraudster impersonates supplier/senior executive
- Requests urgent payment or bank detail change
- Often sent when key person on holiday/sick
 
 **Controls:**
- Verify ALL bank changes via known phone number
- Dual authorization for payment >£X
- Staff training on spotting spoofed emails
 
---
 
**Ransomware Readiness**
 
 **Threat:**
- Systems locked, data encrypted
- Ransom demand (often cryptocurrency)
- Business disruption for weeks/months
 
 **Controls:**
- Regular backups (tested restoration)
- Patch management (keep systems updated)


## Page 35

- Access controls (principle of least privilege)
- Incident response plan (pre-agreed actions)
 
---
 
**IT Control Environment**
 
**High-Risk Areas:**
- Privileged access (who can do what)
- Change management (unauthorized system changes)
- Data loss prevention
- Third-party access (vendors with system access)
 
**Assessment Questions:**
- Do we have IT audit trail/logging?
- Are access rights reviewed regularly?
- How quickly could we detect unauthorized access?
 
### Speaker Notes
- Cyber fraud often overlaps with IT security—but distinct risks
- Email impersonation #1 fraud vector globally
- Question for CIO/CTO (if present): "When did we last test our ransomware 
response plan?"
- Many organisations have strong perimeter security but weak internal controls

## 2. Product Overview

### What We Are

**Fraud Risk Co UK** is a comprehensive SaaS platform for fraud risk assessment and compliance, purpose-built for UK organisations. It replaces expensive, one-off consultancy engagements with continuous, technology-driven fraud risk management.

### The Problem We Solve

- The **Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA)** introduced a "Failure to Prevent Fraud" offence effective September 2025
- **GovS-013** mandates counter-fraud standards for all UK government bodies
- Traditional fraud risk assessments cost **£10,000–£50,000** from Big 4 firms — one-time, quickly outdated
- Generic GRC platforms cost **£5,000–£20,000/year** and aren't tailored to UK fraud legislation
- Most organisations lack in-house fraud expertise

### Our Solution

A **multi-platform ecosystem** covering:
1. **Mobile fraud risk assessment** — 13-module structured assessment with algorithmic risk scoring
2. **Web-based training** — 30-minute interactive workshops with live facilitation
3. **Staff training app** — Mobile-first employee fraud awareness with key-pass access
4. **Budget guide app** — Practical fraud prevention guidance for budget-holders
5. **Central API backend** — Secure, compliant data management with audit trails

### Key Differentiators

- **70–80% cheaper** than traditional consultancy
- **Continuous** compliance vs. one-time assessments
- **Mobile-first** with offline capability for field workers
- **Algorithmic risk scoring** — evidence-based, not subjective
- **UK-specific** — built for ECCTA 2023 and GovS-013
- **Key-pass system** — employers distribute access codes to employees at scale
- **Real-time workshops** — live polling, Q&A, facilitator tools

## 6. Competitive Positioning

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor Type | Typical Cost | Limitation |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Big 4 consultancy** (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) | £10,000–£50,000 per assessment | One-time, quickly outdated, no continuous monitoring |
| **Specialist fraud consultants** | £5,000–£15,000 | Limited scalability, no technology platform |
| **Generic GRC platforms** (ServiceNow, Archer) | £5,000–£20,000/year | Not UK-specific, no ECCTA/GovS-013 alignment |
| **Manual/spreadsheet-based** | Staff time | No audit trail, no risk scoring, error-prone |

### Our Advantage

> "A single fraud risk assessment from a Big 4 firm: £15,000+. Stop FRA Enterprise (full year): £4,995. Save over £10,000 and get continuous compliance."

### Positioning Statement

**For** UK organisations subject to ECCTA 2023 and GovS-013,
**who** need to demonstrate reasonable fraud prevention procedures,
**Fraud Risk Co UK** is the **only SaaS platform** that combines mobile fraud risk assessment, interactive staff training, and continuous compliance monitoring

## 7. Compliance & Regulatory Context

- **Effective:** September 2025
- **Scope:** UK companies meeting 2 of 3 thresholds: 250+ employees, £36M+ turnover, £18M+ balance sheet
- **Offence:** "Failure to Prevent Fraud" — organisations can be criminally liable if an employee commits fraud and the organisation did not have "reasonable prevention procedures" in place
- **Defence:** Demonstrating reasonable prevention procedures (risk assessment, training, monitoring)
- **Our compliance:** ~90% aligned

### GovS-013 — Government Functional Standard for Counter-Fraud

- **Scope:** Mandatory for all UK government bodies and public sector organisations
- **Requirements:** Fraud risk assessment, risk register, action plans, training, audit trails, reporting
- **Our compliance:** ~85% aligned

### GDPR

- **Our compliance:** ~75% aligned
- **Data retention:** 6–7 years (matching regulatory requirements)
- **Security measures:** Encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, audit logging

### Marketing Implications

- **Urgency messaging:** ECCTA came into force September 2025 — organisations must act now
- **Fear of liability:** Board directors face personal criminal liability
- **Regulatory mandate:** Public sector has no choice — GovS-013 is mandatory
- **Evidence-based defence:** Our platform generates the evidence needed to demonstrate compliance

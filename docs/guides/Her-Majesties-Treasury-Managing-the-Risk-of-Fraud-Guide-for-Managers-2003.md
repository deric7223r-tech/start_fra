1. INTRODUCTION
Departmental responsibilities in relation to the management of fraud risk are set out in Chapter 5 of
Government Accounting 2000.  The purpose of this booklet is to show how the principles of sound
risk management, governance and control apply to fraud and other irregular activities that might
lead to fraud.  The booklet:
•
Concentrates on the management of fraud risks; it does not attempt to provide a complete
approach to risk management1. 
•
Provides guidance on options for controlling identified fraud risk to acceptable levels of
exposure.  
Sections 2 – 5 provide a summary of the management of fraud risk.  Section 6 provides managers,
at all levels, with more detail about managing their individual responsibilities in relation to fraud
risk. 
This publication updates an earlier version that was issued in November 1997.
2. WHAT IS FRAUD?
There is currently no precise legal definition of fraud. 
For the purposes of reporting fraud to the Treasury the following crimes fall within the context of the
Fraud Report:
Theft
Dishonestly appropriating the property of another with the intention of permanently depriving them
of it (Theft Act 1968). This may include the removal or misuse of funds, assets or cash.
False Accounting
Dishonestly destroying, defacing, concealing or falsifying any account, record or document required
for any accounting purpose, with a view to personal gain or gain for another, or with intent to cause
loss to another or furnishing information which is or may be misleading, false or deceptive 
(Theft Act 1968).
Bribery and Corruption
The offering, giving, soliciting or acceptance of an inducement or reward that may influence the
actions taken by the authority, its members or officers (Prevention of Corrupt Practices Acts 1889 and
1916). 
Deception
Obtaining property or pecuniary advantage by deception (sections 15 and 16 of the Theft Act 1968)
and obtaining services or evading liability by deception (sections 1 and 2 of the Theft Act 1978).

Collusion
The term “collusion” in the context of reporting fraud to the Treasury is used to cover any case in
which someone incites, instigates, aids and abets, conspires or attempts to commit any of the crimes
listed above.
3. HOW FRAUD OCCURS
Four basic elements are necessary for a fraud to occur:
•
People to carry out the fraud.  They may be individuals within the organisation, outside the
organisation, or a group of people working inside or outside the organisation.
•
Assets to acquire fraudulently.
•
Intent to commit the fraud.
•
Opportunity.
Managers must ensure that the opportunities for fraud are minimised.  While some people would
never contemplate perpetrating a fraud, others may if they thought they could get away with it.  A
high chance of being caught will deter.  Opportunities to commit fraud may be reduced by ensuring
that a sound system of internal control, proportional to risk, has been established and that it is 
functioning as intended (see Appendix 7 for more information).  
4. FRAUD RISK
Fraud is just one of many risks an organisation faces.  However, the deliberate nature of fraud can
make it difficult to detect and deter.
Risk, in the context of managing fraud risk, is the vulnerability or exposure an organisation has
towards fraud and irregularity.  It combines the probability of fraud occurring and the corresponding
impact measured in monetary terms.   Preventive controls and the creation of the right type of 
corporate culture will tend to reduce the likelihood of fraud occurring while detective controls and
effective contingency planning can reduce the size of any losses. 
5. FRAUD RISK MANAGEMENT – AN OVERVIEW
Everybody in an organisation contributes to the management of fraud risk.  This starts at the top
where senior management set the tone of the organisation and promote an anti-fraud culture
throughout the organisation. Operational staff design and implement and operate the control actions
required to minimise risk. The personnel function ensures that the right staff are recruited.
Accommodation services ensure physical security and IT services promote computer and data 
security.  The role of internal audit is to deliver an opinion to the Accounting Officer on the whole of
an organisation’s risk management, control and governance. In relation to fraud this will include the
examination of the adequacy ofarrangements for managing the risk of fraud and ensuring that the
organisation actively promotes an anti-fraud culture.
MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD

## Page 9

The Accounting Officer is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control that 
supports the achievement of departmental policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding public
funds and departmental assets in accordance with Government Accounting. The internal 
control system should be designed to respond to and manage the risks which departments face in the
achievement of their policies, aims and objectives. Managing fraud risk should be seen in the 
context of the management of this wider range of risks. The responsibility for the overall manage-
ment of anti-fraud activities should be allocated to an appropriate senior officer e.g. the Principal
Finance Officer [see Appendix 1].
A clear statement of commitment to ethical behaviour throughout the organisation should help to
ensure that staff know that they are expected to follow the rules without circumventing controls and
that they should avoid or declare any conflicts of interest. The seven principles of public life set out
in the Nolan Committee’s report on Standards in Public Life are relevant here (i.e. selflessness,
integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership - see Appendix 2).
Senior Management should try to create the conditions in which staff have neither the motivation nor
the opportunity to commit fraud. The maintenance of good staff morale may help to minimise the
likelihood of an employee causing harm to the organisation through fraud.
Under the right conditions staff are themselves an excellent deterrent against fraud. There should be
avenues for reporting suspicions of fraud. Staff should be encouraged to report suspicions of fraud
either to their line managers, to internal audit or to a hotline set up for this purpose.
The organisation’s approach to fraud, which contributes to an anti-fraud culture, should be 
communicated throughout the organisation, including contractors and third parties delivering 
services on behalf of the organisation.
Two key documents, used in promoting an anti-fraud culture are the Fraud Policy Statement and
Fraud Response Plan; these are described in more detail in Appendices 3 and 4. Such documents are
considered to be the minimum requirement for any organisation in managing the risk of fraud.
Anti-fraud policies should make it absolutely clear “to all those who seek to defraud the government
that such action is unacceptable and will not be tolerated” (Government Accounting 2000, Chapter 5,
paragraph 5.1.1).  Most people accept that this does not mean that fraud can be wiped out totally or
that it is cost effective to prosecute every suspected case through the courts.  Changing people’s 
attitudes to the social acceptability of fraud can take several forms such as statements in departmen-
tal policies, warnings on official forms, publicity campaigns and policy statements on websites.
In addition departments should undertake a systematic assessment of fraud risk. The level and depth
of this assessment will be determined by the vulnerability or exposure an organisation feels
it has in relation to fraud and irregularity. Fraud risk assessment is described in more detail 
in Section 6.
Further Guidance
Some large departments have an inherent risk of fraud (e.g. welfare benefit abuse, tax evasion, 
prescription fraud).  Whilst the general principles in this guidance apply to all departments, it should
be recognised that those departments with a high risk of fraud will have developed targets, 
measures and procedures to reduce the level of fraud risk and this can be an additional source of
guidance and good practice for others in developing their own anti-fraud strategies.
Fraud seminars, held regularly by the Treasury, attempt to bring to the attention of anti-fraud
practitioners examples of good practice developed by others in the public sector.

Additionally, in order to promote cooperation and joint working between different fraud units in
other government departments and local authorities, a number of anti-fraud networks have been
developed (e.g. DfES Fraud Response Liaison Group, CIPFA’s Better Governance Forum Advisory
Panel2).
6. MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD – A RISK BASED APPROACH
A risk-based approach enables organisations to target their resources, both for improving controls
and for pro-active detection, at problem areas.  Developments in corporate governance, including the
requirement for statements on internal control3, create the atmosphere in which fraud can be 
considered as a set of risks to be managed alongside other business risks.  Managing the risk of fraud
should be embedded in the entirety of an organisation’s risk, control and governance procedures.
In broad terms managing the risk of fraud involves:
•
Assessing the organisation’s overall vulnerability to fraud [see 6.1];
•
Identifying the areas most vulnerable to the risk of fraud [see 6.2]; 
•
Assigning ownership [see 6.3];
•
Evaluating the scale of fraud risk [see 6.4];
•
Responding to the risk of fraud [see 6.5]; and
•
Measuring the effectiveness of the fraud-risk strategy [see 6.6].
6.1
Assessing the Organisation’s Overall Vulnerability to Fraud
Vulnerability to fraud can be assessed at different levels in an organization.  A quick assessment of
the overall level of risk an organisation is exposed to is often a good starting point and may 
highlight particular vulnerabilities where some action needs to be taken immediately rather than
wait for the results of a more in-depth risk assessment to be completed.  The checklist in Figure 1
provides a list of questions that might be used to gain an overall assessment of an organisation’s
fraud risk, and introduces some of the elements necessary for managing those risks.
In organisations where the risk of fraud is known to be high, a separate specific fraud risk 
assessment and evaluation may be appropriate [see 6.2 and 6.4]. Where the risk of fraud is 
considered to be low a specific fraud risk assessment may not be necessary, any risks being 
considered instead as part of the organisation’s overall risk assessment as set out in the “Orange
Book”4. However it will still be necessary for those organisations to develop an anti-fraud culture as
outlined in 6.5.1.
A fraud risk assessment should additionally be carried out during the development of any new 
policies, activities or operations to ascertain whether any new risks arise that need to be managed.
The risk assessment should also be reviewed and re-assessed whenever a change in policy occurs or
when changes are made to the way in which a policy is to be implemented.

6.2
Identifying the Areas Most Vulnerable to Fraud
The overview of fraud [6.1] will show the scale and nature of fraud faced by the organisation and the
relative risks between different types of fraud. This will determine whether there is a need to 
perform a more detailed assessment of those risks to provide a guide as to where the department
should focus its efforts in improving control. 
This more detailed assessment of fraud risk will result in an “exposure profile” or fraud risk frame-
work that identifies the areas in which an organisation may face fraud threats and the types of threat
it may face.  It will not be cost effective to cover every possible threat situation therefore the likely
occurrence of potential fraud, and the impact on key organisational objectives must be assessed.  The
steps in this stage include5:
•
Identifying the processes or activities at risk of fraud (Figure 2).  These can be identified
using a number of techniques including:
o  
Commissioning a risk review;
o
Undertaking risk self-assessment through: facilitated workshops and interviews; 
brainstorming; questionnaires; process mapping; and discussions with peers.
o 
Benchmarking – comparisons with other organisations.
o 
Assessing and ranking the nature and extent of vulnerability in each area [Figure 3].
o 
Identifying the particular forms of fraud threat to each area [Figure 4].
6.3
Assigning Ownership
It will be necessary to allocate responsibility for the overall management of fraud risk and for the
management of anti-fraud activities.
All those responsible for managing resources should be aware of the associated fraud risks.  The 
ultimate responsibility and accountability for fraud risk rests with the Accounting Officer although 
specific responsibility for managing the risk of fraud may be allocated to an appropriate senior 
officer such as the PFO.  Where appropriate, the responsible officer should liaise with the Risk
Management Committee and/or Audit Committee in order to ensure that there is consistency in the 
scoring of fraud risk and in action taken to manage it.  However, some fraud risks will require day-
to-day management and it will be important to assign responsibility for managing specific risks,
once identified, at appropriate levels in the organisation.  Establishing accountability and responsi-
bility for specific fraud risks is necessary to:
•
Encourage a culture of fraud risk awareness throughout the organisation;
•
Ensure fraud risk remains well controlled; and
•
Create a framework for the provision of reporting on the management of fraud risk to senior 
management.
Appendix 1 covers responsibilities for fraud risk ownership in more detail.

## Page 12

Checklist for assessing overall fraud risk
•
Does the organisation view fraud within the context of wider risks (e.g. the risk of errors and irregularities)?
•
Is there a definition of the processes or activities open to fraud?  It is fundamental to fraud risk assessment to know the 
scope of the problem the organisation is managing.
•
If the risk of fraud is considered to be high is there a fraud risk assessment including a comprehensive risk log?  The fraud 
risk assessment should include, as a minimum, a basic register or log that identifies the risks. It should include a separate 
assessment of both the impact and the likelihood of each risk and should be a living document that is continuously updated 
to reflect changing circumstances.
•
Does the organisation have effective recruitment procedures to reduce the risk of employing potential fraudsters?  Confirm 
that employee details and references are thoroughly checked.
•
How does the organisation demonstrate zero tolerance to fraud?  Government bodies should have a policy demonstrating 
to all those that might seek to defraud the Government that such action is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. This 
can take many forms such as wording on claim forms and declarations, advertising campaigns, statements on websites, and 
publicity about sanctions including prosecutions. All staff and external contractors should be aware of the organisation’s 
attitude to fraud and their consequences.
•
Is there a clear statement of commitment to ethical business behaviour throughout the organisation to help ensure that staff
know that they are expected to follow the rules without circumventing controls and that they should avoid or declare any 
conflicts of interest?  
•
Does the organisation have a fraud policy statement to communicate the organisation’s approach to fraud?  Such a state-
ment may include some or all of the following areas:
-  Allocation of responsibilities for the overall management of fraud;
-  The procedures which staff should follow if fraud is discovered;
-  Guidance on training for the prevention and detection of fraud;
- Reference to response plans that have been devised to deal with and minimise the damage caused by fraudulent attack.
•
Does the organisation have a fraud response plan?  It is important that managers know what to do in the event of fraud so 
that they can act without delay.
An effective fraud response plan should be closely tailored to each organisation’s 
circumstances and should reflect the likely nature and scale of losses. A fraud response plan should cover:
-
To whom the fraud or suspicion of fraud should be reported in the first instance (e.g. senior managers, personnel or 
internal audit);
-
How the organisation should investigate fraud;
-
How to secure evidence in a legally admissible form;
-
When and how to contact the police;
-
How to initiate recovery action;
-
Who else to contact for advice (e.g. insurers, regulatory bodies, legal advisers, parent department, press office);
-
How to disseminate the lessons learned from fraud cases.
•
Does the organisation have an effective fraud awareness programme?
•
Does the organisation have clear reporting channels for reporting suspicions of fraud that offer protection to those 
reporting fraud?  Suitable avenues can include line management, senior management, a specialist fraud team or internal audit.
Organisations can also establish fraud hotlines so that staff can report suspicions of fraud confidentially. It is important 
that all cases of reported fraud or suspicions of fraud are acted upon.
•
Does the organisation have an effective framework for reporting details of fraud and thefts to the Treasury to meet the 
requirements of Government Accounting 2000, chapter 5?

Identifying the Processes or Activities at Risk to Fraud
The starting point is to identify the organisation’s major activity areas in terms of:
•
Product and service outputs and deliverables;
•
Operational areas and locations;
•
Revenue generation;
•
Revenue collection;
•
Expenditure;
•
Suppliers and inputs;
•
Asset utilisation, acquisition and disposal;
•
Customer/client records and support.
Figure 2
Assessing and ranking the nature and extent of vulnerability in each area
A rating should be given to each of the areas identified in the previous step in terms of its 
potential vulnerability to both internal and external fraud. All areas should be ranked by their 
vulnerability factor and listed from the highest down to the lowest.
Some common 
criteria/factors used to make judgements about vulnerability include:
•
Materiality;
•
Economic indicators;
•
Fraud history;
•
Last time the activity/function was reviewed;
•
Concerns of management;
•
Staff attitudes and values;
•
Management attitudes and values;
•
Quality of management;
•
Internal control history for the area;
•
Extent of effective reporting mechanisms;
•
Internal and external audit risk assessment ratings for the area;
•
Degree of operational complexity;
•
Overall size, scope and value of activities;
•
Impact of technology.

Identifying the Particular Forms of Fraud Threat to Each Area
Each area can be assessed in terms of particular forms of threat such as:
•
Theft;
•
Misappropriation of funds or assets;
•
Fraudulent administration of contracts;
•
Falsification of source records for improper advantage.
Figure 4
6.4
Evaluating the Scale of Fraud Risk
In deciding how to handle the fraud risks identified in the exposure profile it is important to 
evaluate their significance. Risk evaluation and assessment will inform decisions about the areas of
risk where action needs to be taken, and the relative priority of those risks. Figure 5 illustrates just
one approach to this.
An analysis of threats against compensating factors such as internal controls is a key part of this task.
This phase of the risk assessment seeks to determine the extent to which existing internal controls are
sufficient to counter the fraud threats that have been identified [see 6.5.2]
Evaluating the scale of fraud risks
Once risks have been identified, an assessment of the possible impact and corresponding likeli-
hood of occurrence should be made using consistent parameters that will enable the development
of a prioritised risk analysis. Management should agree on the most appropriate definition and 
number of categories to be used when assessing both the likelihood and impact of each risk. The
assessment of the impact of the risk should not simply take account of the financial impact but
should also consider the organisation’s reputation, and recognise the potential political and 
commercial sensitivities involved. The analysis should be either qualitative or quantitative, and
should be consistent to allow comparisons. The qualitative approach usually involves grading risks
in high, medium or low categories6.

6.5
Responding to the Risk of Fraud 
Once the risks have been evaluated and prioritised consideration can be given to identifying
appropriate responses. Responding to the risk of fraud involves compiling anti-fraud control policies
and fraud response plans.  Additionally it also involves putting in place effective accounting and
operational controls and the maintenance of an ethical climate that encourages staff at all levels to
actively participate in protecting public money and property.
Responses to fraud risk include:
•
Developing and promoting an anti-fraud culture [6.5.1].
•
Allocating responsibilities for the overall management of fraud risk and for the management
of specific fraud risks [6.3].
•
Establishing cost effective internal controls to detect and deter fraud that are commensurate
with the identified risk [6.5.2].
•
Establishing anti-fraud related PSA/SDA targets where appropriate [6.5.3].  
•
Developing the right skills and expertise required to manage the risk of fraud effectively and
to respond effectively to fraud when it occurs [6.5.4]. 
•
Responding effectively to fraud when it occurs [6.5.5].
•
Establishing appropriate avenues for reporting fraud [6.5.6].  
•
Monitoring the implementation of specific actions determined by management to reduce the
risk of fraud [6.5.7].  
•
Continuously monitoring the risk environment [6.5.8].
6.5.1
Developing and promoting an anti-fraud culture
These areas are covered in more detail in Appendix 2.
Creating an anti-fraud culture involves:
•
Having a clear statement of ethical values;
•
Establishing a clear anti-fraud policy (Appendix 3) and fraud response plan (Appendix 4);
•
Promoting staff awareness of fraud;
•
Recruiting honest staff (checking references etc); and
•
Maintaining good staff morale.
MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD

## Page 16

6.5.2
Establishing cost effective internal controls that are commensurate with the 
identified risk
There are a range of controls (e.g. physical checks, reconciliation, supervisory checks, segregation
and rotation of duties, and clear roles and responsibilities) that address risk, including that of fraud.
Departmental managers should consider which controls are most appropriate in their particular 
circumstances.  In designing control, it is important that the control put in place is proportional to
the identified risk.  Every control action has an associated cost and it is important that the control
action offers value for money in relation to the risk that it is controlling.
Internal control can be classified in four ways:
•
Detective controls: those established to spot errors, omissions and fraud after the events
have taken place. See Appendix 5
for more information about detecting fraud.  Appendix
6 is a list of useful Fraud Indicators.
•
Directive controls: those designed to ensure that a particular outcome is achieved.  An 
example of this type of control is that staff be required to put the fraud response plan into
action immediately a fraud is suspected or discovered;
•
Preventive controls: those designed to limit the possibility of an undesirable outcome (e.g. a
fraud) being realised.  These are covered in Appendix 7. 
•
Corrective controls: those designed to correct undesirable outcomes that have been realised.
For examples of internal controls in specific areas see Appendix 8. 
6.5.3
Establishing anti-fraud related PSA/SDA targets
The requirement to cover fraud in SDAs does not preclude the possibility of fraud targets in those
PSAs where anti-fraud work may be of major political significance.  Fraud is usually used to describe 
depriving someone of something by deceit.  Errors in payments and other irregularities are 
extremely costly too, and should be a cause for concern and managerial corrective action.  Rather
than focusing on actual or possible crimes, it is therefore often sensible to look at irregularities more
broadly - if high rates of error indicate some systemic or managerial problems in an area, it can also
be a good signal of where anti-fraud attention should be targeted.  Government has to consider two
different types of fraud - internal and external.  The most appropriate measures will vary from
department to department, and targets are only likely to be appropriate where there is a significant
problem.  Targeting fraud and error is also not simple.  
Whilst the obvious targets may be detection (and even recovery) rates, it is also vital to encourage
fraud and error prevention, as it is the overall reduction in the volume of irregularity that is at issue.
Targets focused on detection alone, without also monitoring prevention, can lead to perverse results,
actually encouraging prevention slackness.  [Source: sr2002 guidance7]
Work done by those departments with an inherent risk of fraud (e.g. DWP, Inland Revenue, Customs
and Excise, NHS) can be a useful source of guidance about setting targets and measures to be used
to reduce the level of fraud risk faced.  Useful sources of information include:

6.5.4
Developing the right skills and expertise
This can be achieved by:
•
Developing competency levels for both specialist anti-fraud personnel and more general 
operational staff, and 
•
Identifying a range of training courses/development events designed to enable staff to meet
those competency levels. These can either be developed “in-house” or procured, and can
include:
o 
events on general subjects e.g. fraud identification, preventing fraud, IT crime, or
o 
technical and specialist courses for key staff (e.g. managing a fraud incident, 
investigating a fraud, interviewing).
6.5.5
Responding effectively to fraud when it occurs
Depending on the significance of the fraud, the fraud investigation process involves some or all of
the following:
•
Ensuring that the actions to take if fraud is discovered are clearly described in the 
organisation’s Fraud Response Plan.
•
Senior management providing the direction for any fraud investigation.
•
Establishing clear terms of reference for the investigation.
•
Appointing a Fraud Investigation Officer (FIO) to take charge of the investigation (usually 
a senior manager).
•
Setting up a mechanism to report on progress of the investigation to appropriate senior 
levels of management.
•
Controlling the investigation through procedures set out in the Fraud Response Plan.
•
The overall investigation process involves:
o 
Maintaining confidentiality;
o 
Recovering assets;
o 
Forensic investigations and protection of evidence;
o 
Interviewing witnesses and dealing with employees under suspicion;
MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD
11

12
o 
Controlling police involvement;
o 
Managing civil proceedings;
o 
Liaising with experts and regulators;
o 
Preparing media statements; and
o 
Reporting progress and findings to senior management.
•
Ensuring that effective controls are in place to preserve all forms of evidence.  This is a key
factor if the fraudster is to be prosecuted successfully as evidence must be legally admissible
in court. 
•
Deciding at an early stage the action to be taken with persons under suspicion and whether 
suspension or dismissal is necessary.  Arrangements for interviewing suspects must be made
and if criminal proceedings are initiated the Police must be involved.
•
Adhering to a “fair and reasonable” approach in interviews at all times.  
•
Setting up adequate measures to protect the business throughout the investigation process 
particularly when issuing statements to the media.
•
Initiating a thorough review of all operating procedures in areas affected by the fraud.
Comprehensive reports presented to management should set out:
o 
Findings;
o 
Perceived weaknesses;
o 
Lessons learned; and 
o 
Improvements required to reduce the risk of recurrence.
6.5.6
Establishing appropriate avenues for reporting fraud
There should be avenues for reporting suspicions of fraud.  Staff should be encouraged to report 
suspicions of fraud either to their line mangers, to internal audit or possibly to a hotline set up for
the purpose.  It is important that staff know where to report their suspicions and that any suspicions
of fraud reported in this way are seen to be acted upon by management. Members of the public
should also be encouraged to report their suspicions of fraud through advertising campaigns, 
offering rewards, ensuring that avenues for reporting fraud are widely publicised and assuring
whistleblowers that any information received will be treated confidentially.
Of interest in this area is the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 which came into force on 2nd July
1999.  The Act takes effect as an amendment of the Employment Rights Act 1996 and, as an 
employment rights measure, provides remedies for workers who are dismissed or subject to 
detriment for making qualifying disclosures.  In protecting workers who make responsible 
disclosures, it should also help encourage a climate of greater openness and accountability in 
dealing with wrongdoing within organisations, public and private sector alike.  It does this by 
providing some protection to whistleblowers from unfair dismissal and victimisation.

6.5.7
Monitoring the implementation of specific actions determined by management 
to reduce the risk of fraud
A system is required to monitor and follow up implementation of specific actions determined 
by management.  A detailed timetable should be established for each item requiring action and 
regular progress reports produced for senior management review. It is essential to monitor 
this timetable through the Risk Committee, where an organisation has such a body, through the
Audit Committee when there is no separate Risk Committee or for somebody to monitor and report
to senior management.
6.5.8
Continuously monitoring the risk environment
The risk environment is constantly changing and priorities of objectives and the consequent 
importance of risks on the fraud risk profile will shift and change.  Risk models have to be
regularly revisited and reconsidered in order to have assurance that the fraud risk profile continues
to be valid.  Control systems should be reviewed at regular intervals and in particular after 
restructuring, downsizing, changes in business processes, following identification of weaknesses, the
introduction of new computer systems, and after an incident of fraud.  The risk of fraud should also
be considered along with other risks when major new policies are being developed, where a change
in policy occurs or where changes are made to the way in which policy is to be implemented.
6.6.
Measuring the Effectiveness of the Fraud-risk Strategy
It is essential that assurance about the effectiveness of actions taken to reduce the risk of fraud be
obtained.  The person assigned responsibility for the management of anti-fraud activities [see 6.3]
will need to be aware of the many different ways that assurances can be obtained:
•
Reporting: “Stewardship Reporting”.  This is where designated managers report upwards to
the Accounting Officer at least annually, through the mechanisms established for risk 
ownership, assurances on the work they have done to manage risk and operate the 
appropriate control procedures;
•
Where Control Risk Self Assessment is used, the results of exercises and assurances obtained
should be reported through the risk owner to the Accounting Officer;
•
Internal Audit.  The primary role of internal audit is to provide an independent and objective
opinion to the Accounting Officer on risk management, control and governance, by 
measuring and evaluating their effectiveness in achieving the organisation’s agreed 
objectives.  Internal audit also provides an independent and objective consultancy service 
to help line management improve the organisation’s risk management, control and 
governance8;
•
PSA/SDA monitoring systems provide management information which can contribute to the
overall assurance;
•
The work of other review bodies (e.g. Accounts Inspection Teams, Compliance Review
Teams) can also contribute to the overall assurance.

In gaining an assurance about the overall effectiveness of the anti-fraud measures established by the
organisation it will be necessary for a judgment to be formed based on the various forms of 
assurance available. Some coordination of the reporting mechanisms will therefore be necessary to 
facilitate this process. 
7. REPORTING FRAUD TO THE TREASURY
Government Accounting 2000, Chapter 5, requires government departments and their agencies to
report details of thefts and fraud within certain categories to HM Treasury annually (e.g. internal
frauds, contractor frauds, some other frauds that contain useful lessons for a wider audience).
Central government bodies are also required to report details of any novel or unusual frauds to the
Treasury as soon as they become aware of them. Treasury will circulate details of cases to other 
government bodies so that they can be aware of the risks, and can take appropriate measures to
reduce the risk of similar frauds being perpetrated against them.  Sponsor departments are also
required to collect data about fraud committed in their Agencies, NDPBs and other bodies for which
they are responsible.  Departments should establish suitable information systems for the collection;
secure storage and retrieval of data relating to all thefts and fraud perpetrated against them and the
bodies for which they are responsible.
Treasury also seeks information concerning the means by which departments develop their 
anti-fraud strategies. An annual questionnaire is issued to every central government organisation
seeking answers to such questions as:
•
Does the organisation have an anti-fraud policy?
•
Is fraud risk regularly reviewed as part of the organisation’s overall assessment of risk?
•
Does the organisation have a fraud response plan?
•
Does the organisation have a clearly established avenue for “whistleblowers”?
Treasury uses the information collected above to produce an annual Fraud Report that aims to
inform departments of the scale and nature of certain categories of fraud, the circumstances in which
these frauds occurred, the means by which they were recovered and the action taken against 
offenders.  The information is provided to help departments learn from the experiences of others
when reviewing and developing their own systems.  The report also aims to increase awareness of
fraud risk in specific areas and suggests ways in which the risk can be managed and reduced.

Appendix 1
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD - RISK OWNERSHIP
Accounting Officers
The Accounting Officer (AO) is personally accountable for his/her organisation and its risk 
management. A framework of senior level delegation is essential to ensure that the responsibility and
authority for implementing control actions is clear. A mechanism for reporting to the AO on risk
issues should be established. Managing fraud risks [internal and external fraud risks] is part of the
management of all other risks and the same principles apply.
Senior Management
Overall responsibility for Managing the Risk of Fraud should be allocated to an appropriate senior
officer, e.g. the Principle Finance Officer. Their specific responsibilities, which can be formally 
delegated, will depend to some extent with the level of fraud risk the organisation is exposed to but
should include some or all of the following:
•
Developing a fraud risk profile and undertaking an annual review of the fraud risks 
associated with each of the key organisational objectives in order to keep the profile current;
•
Establishing an effective anti-fraud policy and fraud response plan, commensurate with the
level of fraud risk identified in the fraud risk profile;
•
Developing appropriate fraud targets – SDA and/or PSA;
•
Designing an effective control environment to prevent fraud commensurate with the fraud
risk profile;
•
Establishing appropriate mechanisms for:
o
reporting fraud risk issues;
o
reporting significant incidents of fraud to the AO;
o
reporting to the Treasury in accordance with GA 2000 Chapter 5; and
o
coordinating assurances about the effectiveness of anti-fraud policies to support the 
Statement of Internal Control.
•
Liaising with the Risk Management Committee and/or Audit Committee as appropriate –
where an organisation has a Risk Management Committee it may be appropriate for 
the reports to go to the AO via that committee. It may also be helpful to ask the Audit
Committee to regularly consider fraud risk management issues and significant instances 
of fraudulent activity;
•
Making sure that all staff are aware of the organisation’s anti-fraud policy and know what
their responsibilities are in relation to combating fraud;
•
Developing skill and experience competency frameworks;


## Page 22

MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD
16
•
Ensuring that appropriate anti-fraud training and development opportunities are available
to appropriate staff in order to meet the defined competency levels;
•
Ensuring that vigorous and prompt investigations are carried out if fraud occurs;
•
Taking appropriate legal and/or disciplinary action against perpetrators of fraud;
•
Taking appropriate action to recover assets;
•
Ensuring that appropriate action is taken to minimise the risk of similar frauds occurring in
future.
Operational Managers
Outside of any more formal delegation of the above duties, all other levels of management are
respon-sible for:
•
Implementing and maintaining effective controls to prevent fraud commensurate with the
fraud risk profile, and
•
Ensuring compliance with anti-fraud policies and fraud response plan.
Individual members of staff
Individual members of staff have an important role to play in combating fraud.  Their responsibili-
ties include:
•
Acting with propriety in the use of official resources and in the handling and use of 
corporate funds whether they are involved with cash or payments systems, receipts or 
dealing with contractors or suppliers;
•
Reporting details immediately to their line manager or other avenue for reporting fraud (e.g.
whistleblowing arrangements) if they suspect that fraud has been committed or see any 
suspicious acts or events.
Internal Audit
The role of internal audit is to deliver an opinion to the Accounting Officer on the whole of an 
organisation’s risk management, control and governance. In relation to fraud this will include the
examination of the adequacy of arrangements for managing the risk of fraud and ensuring that the
organisation actively promotes an anti-fraud culture.  
Internal audit will therefore assist in the deterrence of fraud by examining and evaluating the 
effectiveness of control commensurate with the extent of the potential exposure/risk in the various
segments of an organisation’s operations.  Internal audit’s main responsibility is to ensure that 
management has reviewed its risk exposures and identified the possibility of fraud as a business risk.
Management has the responsibility for conducting fraud investigations but internal audit may be
asked to assist, and in some organisations may have had responsibility for conducting investigations
delegated to them.  Fraud investigation is an area that requires specialist knowledge and where inter-
nal audit has this responsibility they need to develop and maintain appropriate levels of expertise.

Appendix 2
PROMOTING AN ANTI-FRAUD CULTURE
Introduction
Fraud prevention involves more than merely compiling anti-fraud policies.  It also involves putting
in place effective accounting and operational controls and the maintenance of an ethical environment
that encourages staff at all levels to actively participate in protecting public money and property.
Creating an anti-fraud culture involves:
•
Having a clear statement of ethical values;
•
Establishing a clear anti-fraud policy and fraud response plan;
•
Promoting staff awareness of fraud;
•
Recruiting honest staff (checking references etc); and
•
Maintaining good staff morale.
Code of Ethics
As stewards of public funds civil servants must have, and be seen to have, high standards of 
personal integrity.   Staff should not accept gifts, hospitality or benefits of any kind from a third party
that might be seen to compromise their integrity.  
All personnel should be reminded that they are bound by a code of ethics which, unless issued 
separately, should be stated in the anti-fraud policy.  The ethics policy will:
•
Explain that staff must follow the organisation’s rules without circumventing controls;
•
Explain what external interests may give rise to conflicts of interest and require any possible
conflicts of interest to be declared;
•
Define the organisation’s policy on receiving gifts from external parties;
•
Explain why it is necessary to keep certain information about the organisation confidential; 
•
Require employees to report suspected fraud to a named individual or via a fraud hotline;
•
State that breach of the policy will be treated as a disciplinary offence;
•
Provide cross-references to the organisations anti-fraud policy and fraud response plan.
The seven principles of public life set out in the Nolan Committee’s report on Standards in Public Life
are relevant here.  


## Page 24

The Seven Principles of Public Life
Selflessness
Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public 
interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material 
benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.
Integrity
Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or  
other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence 
them in the performance of their official duties.
Objectivity
In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, or 
recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office 
should make choices on merit.
Accountability
Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions 
to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appro-
priate to their office.
Openness
Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the 
decisions and action that they take. They should give reasons for their 
decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest 
clearly demands it.
Honesty
Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating 
to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a 
way that protects the public interest.
Leadership
Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by 
leadership and example.
Fraud Policy
Many organisations use a fraud policy statement to communicate the organisation’s approach to
fraud.  Such a statement may include some or all of the following areas:
•
A statement about the organisation’s attitude to fraud (e.g. zero tolerance);
•
The Code of Ethics;
•
Personnel policies (e.g. recruitment policies);
•
The allocation of responsibilities for the overall management of fraud;
•
Reporting suspicions of fraud, including “hotline” arrangements if used;
•
Whistle blowing arrangements, including compliance with the Public Interest Disclosure Act;
•
The procedures which staff should follow if a fraud is discovered;
•
Guidance on training for the prevention and detection of fraud;
•
Reference to the response plans that have been devised to deal with and minimise the 
damage caused by any fraudulent attack.
An example of a fraud policy statement can be found at Appendix 3.
MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD

## Page 25

Fraud Response Plan
It is important that managers and others know what to do in the event of a fraud so that they can act 
without delay.  It is recommended that departments prepare a fraud response plan.
The objective of a fraud response plan is to ensure that timely and effective action can be taken to:
•
Prevent losses of funds or other assets where fraud has occurred and to maximise recovery 
of losses;
•
Minimise the occurrence of fraud by taking rapid action at the first signs of a problem;
•
Identify the fraudsters and maximise the success of any disciplinary/legal action taken;
•
Minimise any adverse publicity for the organisation, suffered as a result of fraud;
•
Identify any lessons which can be acted upon in managing fraud in the future;
•
Reduce adverse impacts on the business of the organisation;
•
Make people aware of the possible consequences of committing fraud by publicising details
of successful actions taken against perpetrators of fraud.
The existence of a fraud response plan may, in itself, help to act as a deterrent as it shows that an
organisation is prepared to defend itself against the risk of fraud.  Appendix 4 contains more infor-
mation about what to include in a fraud response plan.
Promoting Staff Awareness of Fraud
All staff need to be kept fully informed about the organisation’s anti-fraud policy and what part they
are expected to play in it.  This can be achieved in a number of ways:
•
Give every employee a copy of the organisation’s ethics/anti-fraud policy as part of their
contract of employment or staff handbook;
•
Informing new staff during induction training;
•
Establishing a training programme and ensuring all staff attend it;
•
Making the anti-fraud policy, code of ethics and fraud response plan available to all staff (e.g.
via networked IT systems);
•
Communicating all changes in policy to staff immediately;
•
Including fraud matters in a weekly or monthly newsletter;
•
Reporting to staff outcomes of investigations and disciplinary action against employees who 
perpetrate theft or fraud.

Personnel Policies
Personnel recruitment policies play an important role in reducing the risk of fraud.  Managers and
staff responsible for staff recruitment must adhere strictly to the organisation’s recruitment policy,
particularly in relation to:
•
The screening of references for new employees;
•
Special arrangements for sensitive posts (e.g. checking police records);
•
Detailed appraisal during probationary periods; and
•
Detailed “exit” interviews for employees leaving the organisation.
Maintaining Staff Morale
Managers should try to create the conditions in which staff have neither the motivation nor the
opportunity to commit fraud.  The maintenance of good staff morale may help to minimise the like-
lihood of an employee causing harm to the organisation through fraud.


## Page 27

Appendix 3
EXAMPLE OF AN ANTI-FRAUD POLICY
A fraud policy statement should be simple, focused and easily understood.  It’s contents may vary
from organisation to organisation but you should consider including references to the organisation’s 
determination to:
•
Take appropriate measures to deter fraud;
•
Introduce/maintain necessary procedures to detect fraud;
•
Investigate all instances of suspected fraud;
•
Report all suspected fraud to the appropriate authorities;
•
Assist the police in the investigation and prosecution of suspected fraudsters;
•
Recover from fraudsters any assets wrongfully obtained;
•
Encourage employees to report any suspicion of fraud.

Enterprises”9.
An example of an anti-fraud policy follows.
Introduction
The [Organisation name] requires all staff at all times to act honestly and with integrity and to safe-
guard the public resources for which they are responsible.  The Department will not accept any level
of fraud or corruption; consequently, any case will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with 
appropriately.  The Department is committed to ensuring that opportunities for fraud and corrup-
tion are reduced to the lowest possible level of risk.  
What is Fraud?
No precise legal definition of fraud exists; many of the offences referred to as fraud are covered by
the Theft Acts of 1968 and 1978.   The term is used to describe such acts as deception, bribery, 
forgery, extortion, corruption, theft, conspiracy, embezzlement, misappropriation, false representa-
tion, concealment of material facts and collusion.
“Fraud” is usually used to describe depriving someone of something by deceit, which might either
be straight theft, misuse of funds or other resources, or more complicated crimes like false account-
ing and the supply of false information.  In legal terms, all of these activities are the same crime –
theft.

Avenues for Reporting Fraud
The Department has in place avenues for reporting suspicions of fraud. Staff should report such 
suspicions to their line managers, to the department’s internal audit (or specialist fraud unit), or to
the hotline set up for the purpose. All matters will be dealt with in confidence and in strict accor-
dance with the terms of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.  This statute protects the legitimate
personal interests of staff. Vigorous and prompt investigations will be carried out into all cases of
actual or suspected fraud discovered or reported.
Responsibilities
Chapter 5 of Government Accounting 2000 sets out the responsibilities of departments in relation to
fraud. 
•
The Accounting Officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining a sound system of
internal control that supports the achievement of departmental policies, aims and objectives.
The system of internal control is designed to respond to and manage the whole range of risks
that a department faces. The system of internal control is based on an on-going process
designed to identify the principal risks, to evaluate the nature and extent of those risks and
to manage them effectively. Managing fraud risk will be seen in the context of the manage-
ment of this wider range of risks.
•
Overall responsibility for managing the risk of fraud has been delegated to….. [e.g. the
Principal Finance Officer (PFO)].  Their responsibilities include:
Developing a fraud risk profile and undertaking a regular review of the fraud risks 
associated with each of the key organisational objectives in order to keep the profile 
current;
Establishing an effective anti-fraud policy and fraud response plan, commensurate to 
the level of fraud risk identified in the fraud risk profile;
Developing appropriate fraud targets – SDA and/or PSA;
Designing an effective control environment to prevent fraud commensurate with the 
fraud risk profile;
Establishing appropriate mechanisms for:
o 
reporting fraud risk issues;
o 
reporting significant incidents of fraud to the AO;
o 
reporting to Treasury in accordance with GA 2000 Chapter 5; and
o 
coordinating assurances about the effectiveness of anti-fraud policies to 
support the Statement of Internal Control.
Liaising with the Risk Management Committee and/or Audit Committee.


## Page 29

Making sure that all staff are aware of the organisation’s anti-fraud policy and know 
what their responsibilities are in relation to combating fraud;
Developing skill and experience competency frameworks;
Ensuring that appropriate anti-fraud training and development opportunities are
available to appropriate staff in order to meet the defined competency levels;
Ensuring that vigorous and prompt investigations are carried out if fraud occurs or is 
suspected;
Taking appropriate legal and/or disciplinary action against perpetrators of fraud;
Taking appropriate disciplinary action against supervisors where supervisory failures 
have contributed to the commission of fraud;
Taking appropriate disciplinary action against staff who fail to report fraud;
Taking appropriate action to recover assets;
Ensuring that appropriate action is taken to minimise the risk of similar frauds 
occurring in future.
Operational managers are responsible for:
•
Ensuring that an adequate system of internal control exists within their areas of 
responsibility and that controls operate effectively;
•
Preventing and detecting fraud;
•
Assessing the types of risk involved in the operations for which they are responsible;
•
Reviewing and testing the control systems for which they are responsible regularly;
•
Ensuring that controls are being complied with and their systems continue to operate 
effectively;
•
Implementing new controls to reduce the risk of similar fraud occurring where frauds have
taken place.
Internal audit is responsible for:
•
Delivering an opinion to the Accounting Officer on the adequacy of arrangements for 
managing the risk of fraud and ensuring that the department promotes an anti-fraud culture;
•
Assisting in the deterrence and prevention of fraud by examining and evaluating the 
effectiveness of control commensurate with the extent of the potential exposure/risk in the 
various segments of the department’s operations; 
•
Ensuring that management has reviewed its risk exposures and identified the possibility of
fraud as a business risk;

•
Assisting management in conducting fraud investigations. 
Every member of staff is responsible for:
•
Acting with propriety in the use of official resources and the handling and use of public
funds whether they are involved with cash or payments systems, receipts or dealing with
suppliers;
•
Conducting themselves in accordance with the seven principles of public life set out in the
first report of the Nolan Committee “Standards in Public Life”.  They are: selflessness,
integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership;
•
Being alert to the possibility that unusual events or transactions could be indicators of fraud;
•
Reporting details immediately through the appropriate channel if they suspect that a fraud
has been committed or see any suspicious acts or events;
•
Cooperating fully with whoever is conducting internal checks or reviews or fraud
investigations.
Fraud Response Plan
The department has a Fraud Response Plan that sets out how to report suspicions, how investiga-
tions will be conducted and concluded.  This plan forms part of the department’s anti-fraud policy.
Conclusion
The circumstances of individual frauds will vary.  The department takes fraud very seriously.  All
cases of actual or suspected fraud will be vigorously and promptly investigated and appropriate
action will be taken.


## Page 31

MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD
25
Appendix 4
FRAUD RESPONSE PLANS
A fraud response plan should cover the following areas:
•
Instructions on the action required at the point of discovery;
•
To whom the fraud or suspicion of fraud should be reported in the first instance, for 
example this may a line manager, the nominated “appeals” officer within a department,
through internal procedures authorised by the employer (e.g. fraud hotline), internal audit
department, anti-fraud specialists or exceptionally the Civil Service Commissioners;
•
How the organisation should investigate the fraud and who will lead the investigation.
Depending on the nature of the fraud special investigators, internal auditors who have been
trained in fraud investigation, techniques or a fraud unit may be used. The facts should be 
established quickly by the operational managers; any threat of further frauds or losses should
be removed immediately, for example, by changing procedures or suspending payments;
•
How to secure evidence without alerting suspects at the outset of the investigation;
•
How to secure the evidence in a legally admissible form (e.g. evidence must be carefully 
preserved; it should not be handled and no marks made on original documents; a record
should be kept of anyone handling evidence);
•
Guidance about dealing with employees under suspicion (e.g. prompt action must be taken;
action to suspend or dismiss an employee should be taken in conjunction with the personnel
department; employees under suspicion who are allowed to remain on the premises must be
kept under constant surveillance; make an immediate search of the suspects work area, 
filing cabinets, computer files);
•
Guidance about interviewing (e.g. decisions about interviewing suspects must be made by
senior management; if the Police are to be used they must be involved at an early stage; all
interviews must be conducted under properly controlled conditions in order to ensure that
any statement taken and subsequently used as evidence in a court case will not be rejected
as inadmissible; the guidelines and code of conduct for interviewing suspects issued under
PACE should be applied);
•
When and how to contact the Police.  Any decision about involving the Police must be taken
by senior management.  A record of police contacts should be recorded in this section;
•
Guidance about recovering assets (e.g. action to trace and freeze assets; action to prevent the
release of assets; obtaining search orders); 
•
What experts to contact for advice (e.g. insurers, regulatory body, parent department, 
solicitors, accountants).  There should be a list of these and contact details in this section.  The
right experts should be involved from the start;
•
Advice about briefing those with responsibility for dealing with the media (e.g. must tell
them precisely what information they can release, instruct them to maintain a record of what
information was released and to whom);


## Page 32

MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD
26
•
How to mitigate the threat of future fraud by taking appropriate action to improve controls;
•
How to disseminate the lessons learned from the experience in cases where there may be 
implications for the organisation as a whole.
An effective fraud response plan should be closely tailored to each organisation’s circumstances. It
should reflect the likely nature and scale of losses.

Appendix 5
DETECTING FRAUD
Introduction 
The Treasury’s annual report on fraud perpetrated by civil servants consistently reveals that most
frauds (over 50%) are discovered through the normal operation of control procedures and that
information from third parties accounts for around 30% of cases.  Other ways in which frauds are
detected include:
•
Suspicion;
•
Accident; 
•
Internal/external audit; 
•
Confession; and
•
Staff changes.
Normal Control Procedures
Well-designed and cost effective internal controls should identify a majority of actual or attempted
frauds.  Examples of good internal controls include:
•
Supervision and checking output;
•
Separation of duties to ensure that key functions and controls are not performed by the same
member of staff;
•
Random spot checks by managers;
•
A complete and secure audit trail;
•
Monitoring management information;
•
Budgetary and other financial control;
•
Independent reviews.
More examples of internal controls can be found in Appendix 8.
Information from Third Parties
Under the right conditions staff are themselves an excellent deterrent against fraud.  There should be
avenues for reporting suspicions of fraud.  Staff should be encouraged to report suspicions of fraud
either to their line mangers, to internal audit or possibly to a hotline set up for the purpose.  It is
important that staff know where to report their suspicions and that any suspicions of fraud 
reported in this way are seen to be acted upon by management.  The Public Interest Disclosure Act
1998 protects whistleblowers that make responsible disclosures from dismissal and victimisation.


## Page 34

MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD
28
Members of the public should also be encouraged to report their suspicions of fraud through 
advertising campaigns, offering rewards, ensuring that avenues for reporting fraud are widely 
publicised and assuring whistleblowers that any information received will be treated confidentially.
Computer Assisted Audit Techniques
These can be used to identify unusual types of transaction within a department’s records, which
might be worth further investigation.  Such checks could be built into information systems to pro-
vide regular exception reports to managers on transactions.
Investigation and Analysis Tools
These help fraud investigators to handle their case evidence, for example by highlighting links
between colluding parties or between fraudulent transactions.  These techniques can be used to 
identify indicators of possible fraud including:
•
Duplicate payments;
•
Unusual patterns of works orders (e.g. a large number of jobs valued just below the financial 
limits at which full competition in awarding the work would be employed);
•
Invalid VAT numbers or incorrect amounts of VAT;
•
Unexpected relationships between sub-contractors (e.g. shared addresses, telephones or fax 
numbers, bank accounts or directors).
Data mining is a technique that can be used to identify the relationships between sets of data 
within a department’s databases.  Some of the patterns identified may indicate fraudulent activity or
practices that increase the risk of fraud.  
Data matching can be used to compare computer records held for different purposes or by different 
bodies to identify discrepancies and anomalies.  A department, for instance, could compare its data
on contractors with similar data held by other public sector bodies to see who have committed fraud
to see whether or not they are using the same firms.
Where organisations use data mining or data matching to detect fraud then they need to be aware of
the possible restrictions on the way personal data can be used in fraud detection exercises or fraud
investigations under the Data Protection Act 1998.  The Office of the Information Registrar 
recommends the adoption of Codes of Practice setting out the measures to be adopted by those
engaged in data matching.  The purpose of such codes is to ensure that data matching exercises 
operate with appropriate safeguards to help protect individuals’ privacy and to reduce the risk of
failing to comply with the Data Protection Act. A “Guide to Developing Data Protection Codes of
Practice on Data Matching” can be found on the Office of the Information Registrars website at:
www.dataprotection.gov.uk/match.htm
Fraud Indicators
Fraud indicators are clues or hints that a closer look should be made at an individual, area or 
activity.  All they can do is point the way for further detailed investigation.  See Appendix 6 for
examples of fraud indicators. 


## Page 35

MANAGING THE RISK OF FRAUD
29
Appendix 6
EXAMPLES OF FRAUD INDICATORS
A number of frauds can come to light because of suspicions aroused by, for instance, the behaviour
of certain individuals.  Managers and staff should also be alert to any warning signs that might 
indicate that fraud is taking place.  These may be:
•
Staff under stress without a high workload.
•
First to arrive in the morning, last to leave at night.
•
Egotistical (e.g. scornful of system controls).
•
A risk taker or rule breaker.
•
Reluctance to take leave.
•
Refusal of promotion.
•
Unexplained wealth.
•
Sudden change of lifestyle.
•
New staff resigning quickly.
•
Cosy relationships with suppliers/contractors.
•
Suppliers/contractors who insist on dealing with one particular member of staff.
•
Disgruntled at work, a complainer.
•
Greedy or has genuine financial need.
To spot fraud indicators in individual areas or activities it is important that accepted practices have
been established for the area or activity under review and that the auditor is familiar with them.  The 
following are examples of possible fraud indicators in a number of areas. 
•
Unusual employee behaviour (e.g. a supervisor who opens all incoming mail, refusal to 
comply with normal rules and practices, fails to take leave, managers by-passing 
subordinates, subordinates by-passing managers, living beyond means, regular long-hours 
working, job dissatisfaction/unhappy employee, secretiveness or defensiveness).
•
Key documents missing (e.g. invoices, contracts).
•
Inadequate or no segregation of duties.
•
Absence of controls and audit trails.
•
Inadequate monitoring to ensure that controls work as intended (periodic testing and 
evaluation).
•
Documentation that is photocopied or lacking essential information.
•
Missing expenditure vouchers and official records.
•
Excessive variations to budgets or contracts.
•
Bank and ledger reconciliations are not maintained or cannot be balanced.

•
Excessive movements of cash or transactions between accounts.
•
Numerous adjustments or exceptions.
•
Overdue pay or expense advances.

Duplicate payments.
•
Ghost employees on the payroll.
•
Large payments to individuals.

Unauthorised changes to systems or work practices.
•
Lack of rotation of duties.
•
Policies not being followed.
•
Post Office boxes as shipping addresses.
•
Lowest tenders or quotes passed over with minimal explanation recorded.
•
Single vendors.
•

REDUCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FRAUD
Introduction
Managers must ensure that the opportunities for fraud are minimised.  Separation of duties, 
effective procedures and checks should prevent or deter fraud from occurring.  Opportunities to
commit fraud may be reduced:
•
By ensuring that a sound system of internal control proportional to risk has been established
and that it is functioning as intended;
•
Through the “fear factor” (i.e. the risk of being caught or the severity of the consequences);
•
By changing attitudes to fraud;
•
By making it too much effort to commit.
Internal Control
“Control” is any action, procedure or operation undertaken by management to increase the likeli-
hood that activities and procedures achieve their objectives. Control is a response to risk – it is
intended to contain uncertainty of outcome. 
Some frauds arise because of a system weakness such as a lack of proper control over e.g. placing of 
purchase orders.  Other frauds are the result of failures to follow proper control procedures.  It may
be the result of carelessness in carrying out a check, or it may be that too much trust has been placed
in one individual with no effective separation of duties. Frauds that result from collusion may be
more difficult to detect and prevent as these types of fraud tend to operate within the normal 
control environment.   
In designing control, it is important that the control put in place is proportional to the risk. In most
cases it is normally sufficient to design control to give a reasonable assurance of confining loss
within the risk appetite of the organisation. Every control action has an associated cost and it is
important that the control action offers value for money in relation to the risk that it is controlling.
Generally speaking the purpose of control is to contain risk to a reasonable level rather than to
remove it entirely.
When risks and deficiencies in the level of control are identified it is necessary to choose the most 
appropriate type of controls within the above guidelines.  In respect of fraud risks, prevention is
almost always preferable to detection.  Strong preventive controls should therefore be applied wher-
ever possible.
The following range of controls should be considered always ensuring that a balance between 
identified risk and value for money is maintained:
Physical security: this is a preventive measure which controls or monitors access to assets, 
documentation or IT systems to ensure that there is no unauthorised use, loss or damage.


## Page 38

Assets can range from the computer terminal that sits on the desk to the cheques sent out to pay 
suppliers.  As a general principle all assets should be held securely and access to them restricted as 
appropriate.  The control should apply not only to the premises but also to computers, databases, 
banking facilities, documents and any other area that is critical to the operation of the individual
organisation.  It may even be appropriate to restrict knowledge of the existence of some assets.
Access to computer systems is an important area that should be very tightly controlled, not only to 
prevent unauthorised access and use, but also to protect the integrity of the data - the Data Protection
Act requires computer and data owners to secure information held on their systems which concerns
third parties.  The threat to computers can come from both inside and outside an organisation.  This
threat may increase with the introduction of systems to meet the e-Government target (e.g. to allow
the public to do business electronically with government departments, to link public sector comput-
er systems etc).  Computers are also vulnerable to theft, both in terms of hardware and software.
This type of theft has the additional cost of potential major disruption to the core operations of an
organisation.
Organising: organising involves the allocation of responsibility to individuals or groups so that they
work together to achieve objectives in the most efficient manner.  Major principles in organising 
relevant to fraud are:
•
Clear definition of the responsibilities of individuals for resources, activities, objectives and 
targets.  This includes defining levels of authority.  This is a preventive measure which sets a
limit on the amounts which may be authorised by individual officers. To be effective, checks
need to be made to ensure that transactions have been properly authorised;
•
Establishing clear reporting lines and the most effective spans of command to allow adequate
supervision;
•
Separating duties to avoid conflicts of interest or opportunities for abuse.  This is also
largely a preventive measure which ensures that the key functions and controls over a
process are not all carried out by the same member of staff (e.g. ordering goods should be
kept separate from receipt of goods); similarly authorisation and payment of invoices; and
•
Avoiding undue reliance on any one individual.
Supervision and checking of outputs: supervision is the function by which managers scrutinise
the work and performance of their staff.  It provides a check that staff are performing to meet 
standards and in accordance with instructions.  It includes checks over the operation of controls by
staff at lower levels.  These act as both preventive and detective measures and involve monitoring
theworking methods and outputs of staff.  These controls are vital where staff are dealing with cash
or accounting records.  Random spot checks by managers can be an effective anti-fraud measure.
Audit trail: this is largely a detective control, although its presence may have a deterrent effect and
thus prevent a fraud.  An audit trail enables all transactions to be traced through a system from start
to finish.  In addition to allowing detection of fraud it enables the controls to be reviewed.
Monitoring: management information should include measures and indicators of performance in
respect of efficiency, effectiveness, economy and quality of service.  Effective monitoring, including 
random checks, should deter and detect some types of fraudulent activity.

## Page 39

Evaluation: policies and activities should be evaluated periodically for economy, efficiency and
effectiveness.  The management of the operation may perform evaluations, but they are usually more
effective when performed by an independent team.  Such evaluations may reveal fraud.
Staffing: adequate staffing is essential for a system to function effectively.  Weaknesses in staffing
can negate the effect of other controls.  Posts involving control of particularly high value assets or
resources may need the application of additional vetting procedures.  Rotation of staff between posts
can help prevent or detect collusion or fraud.
Asset accounting: asset registers used for management accounting purposes can help detect losses
that may be caused by fraud.
Budgetary and other financial controls: use of budgets and delegated limits for some categories
of expenditure and other accounting controls should ensure that expenditure is properly approved
and accounted for by the responsible manager.  This should limit the scope for fraud and may result
in some types of fraud being detected.
Systems development: controls over the development of new systems and modifications to 
existing systems or procedures are essential to ensure that the effect of change is properly assessed
at an early stage and before implementation.  Fraud risks should be identified as part of this process
and the necessary improvements in control introduced.
These are only some examples of the types of control that can be used to prevent or detect fraud.  For
examples of internal controls in specific areas see Appendix 8
The “Fear Factor”
Major deterrents to perpetrating fraud are the risk of being caught and the severity of the 
consequences.  The most important fact about deterrence is that it derives from perceived risk and
not actual risk.  A department may manage to increase the actual risk of detection but it will only
achieve a deterrent effect if it ensures that perceptions of risk change too.  Ways in which 
departments can do this include:
•
Warnings on forms such as: “false statements may lead to prosecution”;
•
General publicity;
•
Increasing the severity of penalties;
•
Always taking appropriate action against known perpetrators of fraud.
Changing Attitudes to Fraud
The most effective strategies designed to change attitudes rely on motivation rather than fear.  They
aim to persuade people of the undesirability of a particular behaviour.  Attitude changing strategies
rely to a large extent on publicity campaigns to achieve their effect so it is important that 
departments carry out a full appraisal of the benefits of any proposed advertising campaign and to 
establish some way of measuring the outcomes of such campaigns.  Departments need to be clear
about the objectives and targets of their campaigns.

RISKS AND CONTROLS IN SPECIFIC SYSTEMS
Risks associated with cash handling
There are many risks associated with cash handling.  Theft or misappropriation of cash may be assist-
ed by the suppression, falsification or destruction of accounting records, or where no initial records
are created at all.  This section suggests some controls that should be in place.
Theft
• Cash should be held securely at all times.
• Access to cash should be restricted to named personnel.
• Controls over keys should be set up and keys should only be 
issued to authorised personnel.
• Cash balances should be kept to a minimum, recorded and 
checked periodically.
Income received not brought to account
• Always issue pre-numbered receipts.
• Maintain accurate records of income received.
• Post opening duties should be carried out by at least two people 
and a receipts log completed and signed by both officers.
• Separate duties at key stages of the process:
- post opening and logging of receipts;
- bringing receipts to account and preparation of cash and 
cheques for banking;
- daily cash balancing and bank reconciliations.             
• Regular and random management checks of source 
documentation, accounting records and  bank reconciliations; 
• Rotation of staff.
Illegal transfer or diversion of money

• System access to make and authorise these changes 
should be carefully restricted and logged.
• Provide adequate supervision of all staff particularly new, 
inexperienced or temporary staff.
• All payments should be independently authorised  before they 
are made.
• Restrict knowledge of transfer codes (and passwords if 
payments are initiated internally by computer) to approved 
personnel.  Transfer codes and passwords should be changed 
frequently and always when staff leave.


## Page 41

• Payment reports should be independently reviewed for accuracy
immediately before the transfer of funds occurs.
• Separation of duties between those setting up payment accounts 
and those authorised to trigger payments should be maintained 
at all times. Similarly separate duties of receiving goods and 
services from the process of making payment.
False creation of or unauthorised

of funds.
• Independent checks to ensure amendments have been carried 
out correctly.  These should be evidenced by signature, together 
with name and grade.
• Authorisation levels and frequency of checks, including the use 
of spot checks, should depend on:
- the amounts involved;
- the degree of risk associated with the system.
• Accounting records and petty cash should be reconciled on a 
regular basis.  These reconciliations should be recorded and 
independently reviewed.  Discrepancies should be investigated 
and resolved.
• Any discrepancies that cannot be resolved, or any losses that 
have occurred should be reported as part of a formally defined 
process.
• Suspense accounts should be reviewed on a regular basis to 
confirm their validity.

stationery.
• Signatories and delegated powers should be established for 
cheques and payable orders.
• Cheques and payable orders should be checked to source 
documentation before issue.
• Use restrictive crossings such as “non-transferrable” and 
“a/c payee”.
• Ensure that addresses to which payable instruments are sent are 
correct.  For large  value payments check encashment to ensure 
that the intended recipient did receive the  payment.

• Discourage the fraudulent amendment of cheque details by 
careful choice of inks and printers so that the print produced on 
cheques is as indelible as possible.

• Write payee details in full rather than use abbreviations or 
acronyms.
• Fill up blank spaces with insignificant characters such as asterisks.
• Use envelopes that make it less obvious that they contain 
cheques for mailing purposes.
• Ensure that signed cheques are not returned to payment staff.
• Reconcile bank statements with cheque listings regularly.
Risks associated with payroll
Risks that may be associated with the payroll function include the introduction of non-existent (ghost)
employees, unauthorised amendments made to input data, and the payment of excessive overtime, bonus
or travel claims.  This section suggests some controls that should be in place.

checked by management.
• Produce regular exception reports (e.g. emergency tax codes for 
more than 6 months, no NI numbers, duplicate payees) for 
investigation by management.
• Subject the payroll masterfile to periodic checks by personnel to 
ensure that each post is authorised, that the correct person is in 
post, that the person exists and that basis salaries and 
allowances  are correct.

• Establish a formal process that involves line managers 
approving and reviewing work plans and programmes for visits,
especially for staff where there is no countersigning requirement.
• Institute checks by countersigning officers of claims against 
approved work plans, standard mileages for regular destinations
and primary evidence such as hotel bills, rail tickets and taxi
receipts.
• Ensure that countersigning officers pass approved claim forms 
direct to the finance team.
• Instruct countersigning officers to initial and amendments to 
details  on claim forms and finance teams to reject any claims 
where  amendments have not been initialled.
• Instruct finance teams to ensure that correct rates are claimed, 
substantiating documents (e.g. hotel invoices) are included and 
to  compare counter signatures on claims against 
sample signatures provided by authorised countersignatories.
• Random management checks should be carried out to verify 
details  on claims and to ensure that finance team  checks are 
applied rigorously to claims.
• Budget holders should be provided with sufficient information 
to  enable them to monitor travel costs against budget.
Risks associated with grant funding
This section sets out examples of the controls that should be in place to counter the fraud risks 
specifically associated with payment of grants:
Grant funds are misappropriated.
• Strict guidelines on the claims procedures should be established 
and communicated to all staff employed to process claims, 
especially new recruits.
• Delegated authorities and levels of authorisation should be 
established.
• Claims should be assessed to determine their complexity and 
level  of risk and allocated accordingly to officers with the 
relevant experience and expertise.
• All claims and supporting evidence should be checked for 
accuracy, completeness and timeliness.
• No single officer should be involved in processing  and 
authorising a complete claim and appropriatesegregation should
be maintained  throughout the process.
• Good quality case records should be maintained.
• An officer with the appropriate delegated authority should give 
the  final approval for a claim.

• Training needs should be assessed periodically and appropriate 
training plans drawn up.
• All claims relating to an individual or organisation should be 
identified and cross-referenced to reduce the risk of duplicating 
payments. 
• Periodic reassessments should be carried out where on-going 
claims are concerned. 
• Copies of all outgoing correspondence should be traceable to the
originating officer.
• Liaise with other grant making organisations to check 
application data and to avoid making payments where the 
payment of other  grants mean that claimants are not entitled to 
them.
• Reports of grant payments should be regularly scrutinised to 
ensure that only approved grants have been paid out and that 
they  have gone to the correct recipients.
• Systems operated by organisations who receive grant funding 
for  specific projects should be reviewed to ensure that the 
spending of  grant monies is adequately controlled.
Risks associated with purchasing
Risks associated with the operation of purchasing systems include the false input of invoices, the 
diversion of payments and misappropriation of purchases.  This section sets out some examples of con-
trols that should be in place to reduce the risk of fraud in this area:
Unauthorised use of purchasing 
• Restrict opportunity to generate payment by using sequentially

• Authorised signatories and their authorisation limits should be 
established for requisitioning and placing orders and adhered to.
• Invoices should be authorised and matched to orders before the 
invoice is certified for payment.
• Stock records should be maintained up to date so that stocks, 
stock  usage and orders can be monitored.
• There should be separation of duties between those ordering, 
receiving goods, and approving and paying invoices.  This 
separation of duties should be  reviewed regularly.
• Authorised staff only make amendments to standing data such 
as the supplier records.

relationship or is otherwise a reputable merchant.
• Departments should appoint an individual to be the  cardholder 
manager who will be responsible for  appointing cardholders 
and  for dealing with the  card-issuing bank.
• The card-issuing bank should distribute the cards to a point in 
the department agreed with the departmental cardholder 
manager.   The cardholder should sign the card in the presence 
of the card holder manager.  The department should maintain an
up to date list of all its cardholders.
• Cards should only be issued by the bank upon request by the 
card holder manager.
• Cards must be returned to the cardholder manager when card-
holders move or cease to be cardholders.  The cardholder 
manager  should ensure that the card is destroyed and the 
record of cardholders amended.
• Departmental policy and advice on using GPCs should be 
clearly  documented, kept up to date and effectively 
communicated to all staff.
• Cardholders must hold cards securely.
• Cardholders must check all entries on statements supplied by 
the  bank and refer any discrepancies to the cardholder manager.
• Budget holders should carry out periodic checks to ensure that 
GPC statements are properly reconciled and that only authorised
purchases are made.

• Keep a record of the retailer’s contact details, including a street 
address and non-mobile telephone number.  Beware if these 
details  are not available on the website.  Do not rely on the 
e-mail  address alone.
• Click on the security icon to see if the retailer has an encryption 
certificate.  This should explain the type and extent of security 
and  encryption it uses.  Only use companies that have an 
encryption certificate and use secure transaction technology.
• If you have any queries or concerns, telephone the company 
before giving them your card details to reassure yourself that the 
company is legitimate.
• Print out your order and consider keeping copies of the retailer’s
terms and conditions and returns policy.  Be aware that there 
may  well be additional charges such as postage and VAT, 
particularly if  you are purchasing goods from traders abroad.  
When buying from  overseas always err on the sideof caution 
and remember that it  may be difficult to seek redress if 
problems arise.
• Check statements from your bank or card issuer carefully as 
soon  as you receive them.  Raise any discrepancies with the 
retailer concerned in the first instance.  If you find any 
transaction on your  statement that you are certain you did not 
make, contact your card issuer immediately.
• Check that you are fully aware of any payment commitments 
you  are entering into, including whether you are instructing a 
single payment or a series of payments.
• Never disclose your card’s PIN to anyone, including people 
claiming to be from your bank or the Police, and NEVER write it
down or send it over the Internet.
• If you have any doubts about giving your card details, find 
another method of payment.
Risks associated with the use of contractors

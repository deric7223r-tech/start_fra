Managing the Business Risk of Fraud: A Practical Guide
Fraud is any intentional act or omission designed to deceive others, resulting in the victim suffering a 
loss and/or the perpetrator achieving a gain1.
INTRODUCTION 
All organizations are subject to fraud risks. Large frauds have led to the downfall of entire organizations, massive 
investment losses, significant legal costs, incarceration of key individuals, and erosion of confidence in capital 
markets. Publicized fraudulent behavior by key executives has negatively impacted the reputations, brands, and 
images of many organizations around the globe. 
Regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), the 1997 Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention, the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. Federal 
Sentencing Guidelines of 2005, and similar legislation throughout the world have increased management’s 
responsibility for fraud risk management.
Reactions to recent corporate scandals have led the public and stakeholders to expect organizations to take a 
“no fraud tolerance” attitude. Good governance principles demand that an organization’s board of directors, or 
equivalent oversight body, ensure overall high ethical behavior in the organization, regardless of its status as public, 
private, government, or not-for-profit; its relative size; or its industry. The board’s role is critically important because 
historically most major frauds are perpetrated by senior management in collusion with other employees2. Vigilant 
handling of fraud cases within an organization sends clear signals to the public, stakeholders, and regulators about 
the board and management’s attitude toward fraud risks and about the organization’s fraud risk tolerance.
In addition to the board, personnel at all levels of the organization — including every level of management, staff, 
and internal auditors, as well as the organization’s external auditors — have responsibility for dealing with fraud 
risk. Particularly, they are expected to explain how the organization is responding to heightened regulations, as well 
as public and stakeholder scrutiny; what form of fraud risk management program the organization has in place; how 
it identifies fraud risks; what it is doing to better prevent fraud, or at least detect it sooner; and what process is in 
place to investigate fraud and take corrective action3. This guide is designed to help address these tough issues.
This guide recommends ways in which boards4, senior management, and internal auditors can fight fraud in 
their organization. Specifically, it provides credible guidance from leading professional organizations that defines 
principles and theories for fraud risk management and describes how organizations of various sizes and types can

those developed by the sponsoring organizations and endorsers of this guide.

statements investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing 
Standard No. 5 (AS5), An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated With an Audit of Financial Statements, for 
comments on fraud responsibilities.

performance and financial reporting.

establish their own fraud risk management program. The guide includes examples of key program components and 
resources that organizations can use as a starting place to develop a fraud risk management program effectively 
and efficiently. Each organization needs to assess the degree of emphasis to place on fraud risk management based 
on its size and circumstances.
Executive Summary
As noted, fraud is any intentional act or omission designed to deceive others, resulting in the victim suffering a loss 
and/or the perpetrator achieving a gain. Regardless of culture, ethnicity, religion, or other factors, certain individuals 
will be motivated to commit fraud. A 2007 Oversight Systems study5 discovered that the primary reasons why fraud 
occurs are “pressures to do ‘whatever it takes’ to meet goals” (81 percent of respondents) and “to seek personal 
gain” (72 percent). Additionally, many respondents indicated that “they do not consider their actions fraudulent”  
(40 percent) as a reason for wrongful behavior. 
Only through diligent and ongoing effort can an organization protect itself against significant acts of fraud. Key 
principles for proactively establishing an environment to effectively manage an organization’s fraud risk include:
Principle 1:	 As part of an organization’s governance structure, a fraud risk management program6 
should be in place, including a written policy (or policies) to convey the expectations of the 
board of directors and senior management regarding managing fraud risk.
Principle 2: 	 Fraud risk exposure should be assessed periodically by the organization to identify specific 
potential schemes and events that the organization needs to mitigate.
Principle 3: 	 Prevention techniques to avoid potential key fraud risk events should be established, where 
feasible, to mitigate possible impacts on the organization.
Principle 4: 	 Detection techniques should be established to uncover fraud events when preventive 
measures fail or unmitigated risks are realized.
Principle 5: 	 A reporting process should be in place to solicit input on potential fraud, and a coordinated 
approach to investigation and corrective action should be used to help ensure potential 
fraud is addressed appropriately and timely.
The following is a summary of this guide, which provides practical evidence for organizations committed to 
preserving stakeholder value. This guide can be used to assess an organization’s fraud risk management program,  
as a resource for improvement, or to develop a program where none exists. 
Fraud Risk Governance 
Organization stakeholders have clearly raised expectations for ethical organizational behavior. Meanwhile, 
regulators worldwide have increased criminal penalties that can be levied against organizations and individuals  
5 The 2007 Oversight Systems Report on Corporate Fraud, www.oversightsystems.com.
6 Fraud risk management programs, also known as anti-fraud programs, can take many forms, as noted in Section 1 (Fraud Risk Governance) 
under the Fraud Risk Management Program heading.

who participate in committing fraud. Organizations should respond to such expectations. Effective governance 
processes are the foundation of fraud risk management. Lack of effective corporate governance seriously 
undermines any fraud risk management program. The organization’s overall tone at the top sets the standard 
regarding its tolerance of fraud.
The board of directors should ensure that its own governance practices set the tone for fraud risk management 
and that management implements policies that encourage ethical behavior, including processes for employees, 
customers, vendors, and other third parties to report instances where those standards are not met. The board 
should also monitor the organization’s fraud risk management effectiveness, which should be a regular item on its 
agenda. To this end, the board should appoint one executive-level member of management to be responsible for 
coordinating fraud risk management and reporting to the board on the topic.
Most organizations have some form of written policies and procedures to manage fraud risks. However, few have 
developed a concise summary of these activities and documents to help them communicate and evaluate their 
processes. We refer to the aggregate of these as the fraud risk management program, even if the organization has 
not formally designated it as such.  
While each organization needs to consider its size and complexity when determining what type of  
formal documentation is most appropriate, the following elements should be found within a fraud risk  
management program:
• 
Roles and responsibilities.
• 
Commitment.
• 
Fraud awareness.
• 
Affirmation process. 
• 
Conflict disclosure.
• 
Fraud risk assessment.
• 
Reporting procedures and whistleblower protection.
• 
Investigation process. 
• 
Corrective action.
• 
Quality assurance.
• 
Continuous monitoring.
Fraud Risk Assessment
To protect itself and its stakeholders effectively and efficiently from fraud, an organization should understand  
fraud risk and the specific risks that directly or indirectly apply to the organization. A structured fraud risk 
assessment, tailored to the organization’s size, complexity, industry, and goals, should be performed and updated 
periodically. The assessment may be integrated with an overall organizational risk assessment or performed 
as a stand-alone exercise, but should, at a minimum, include risk identification, risk likelihood and significance 
assessment, and risk response.


## Page 9

Fraud risk identification may include gathering external information from regulatory bodies (e.g., securities 
commissions), industry sources (e.g., law societies), key guidance setting groups (e.g., Cadbury, King Report7, and The 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)), and professional organizations (e.g., 
The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the Association 
of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), The CICA Alliance for 
Excellence in Investigative and Forensic Accounting, The Association of Certified Chartered Accountants (ACCA), 
and the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), plus others noted in Appendix A of this document). Internal 
sources for identifying fraud risks should include interviews and brainstorming with personnel representing a broad 
spectrum of activities within the organization, review of whistleblower complaints, and analytical procedures.
An effective fraud risk identification process includes an assessment of the incentives, pressures, and opportunities 
to commit fraud. Employee incentive programs and the metrics on which they are based can provide a map to where 
fraud is most likely to occur. Fraud risk assessment should consider the potential override of controls by management 
as well as areas where controls are weak or there is a lack of segregation of duties.
The speed, functionality, and accessibility that created the enormous benefits of the information age have also 
increased an organization’s exposure to fraud. Therefore, any fraud risk assessment should consider access and 
override of system controls as well as internal and external threats to data integrity, system security, and theft of 
financial and sensitive business information.
Assessing the likelihood and significance of each potential fraud risk is a subjective process that should consider not 
only monetary significance, but also significance to an organization’s financial reporting, operations, and reputation, 
as well as legal and regulatory compliance requirements. An initial assessment of fraud risk should consider the 
inherent risk8 of a particular fraud in the absence of any known controls that may address the risk. 
Individual organizations will have different risk tolerances. Fraud risks can be addressed by establishing practices 
and controls to mitigate the risk, accepting the risk — but monitoring actual exposure — or designing ongoing or 
specific fraud evaluation procedures to deal with individual fraud risks. An organization should strive for a structured 
approach versus a haphazard approach. The benefit an implemented fraud risk management program provides 
should exceed its cost. Management and board members should ensure the organization has the appropriate control 
mix in place, recognizing their oversight duties and responsibilities in terms of the organization’s sustainability 
and their role as fiduciaries to stakeholders, depending on organizational form. Management is responsible for 
developing and executing mitigating controls to address fraud risks while ensuring controls are executed efficiently 
by competent and objective individuals. 
Fraud Prevention and Detection
Fraud prevention and detection are related, but are not the same concepts. Prevention encompasses policies, 
procedures, training, and communication that stop fraud from occurring, whereas, detection focuses on activities 
and techniques that promptly recognize timely whether fraud has occurred or is occurring. 
7 The Cadbury Report refers to The Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, issued by the United 
Kingdom on Dec. 10, 1992 and the King Report refers to the King Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa, issued in 1994.
8 Inherent risk is the risk before considering any internal controls in place to mitigate such risk.


## Page 10

While prevention techniques do not ensure fraud will not be committed, they are the first line of defense in 
minimizing fraud risk. One key to prevention is promoting from the board down throughout the organization an 
awareness of the fraud risk management program, including the types of fraud that may occur. 
Meanwhile, one of the strongest fraud deterrents is the awareness that effective detective controls are in place. 
Combined with preventive controls, detective controls enhance the effectiveness of a fraud risk management 
program by demonstrating that preventive controls are working as intended and by identifying fraud if it does  
occur. Although detective controls may provide evidence that fraud has occurred or is occurring, they are not 
intended to prevent fraud.  
Every organization is susceptible to fraud, but not all fraud can be prevented, nor is it cost-effective to try. An 
organization may determine it is more cost-effective to design its controls to detect, rather than prevent, certain 
fraud schemes. It is important that organizations consider both fraud prevention and fraud detection.
Investigation and Corrective Action
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against fraud. As a result, the board should ensure 
the organization develops a system for prompt, competent, and confidential review, investigation, and resolution of 
instances of noncompliance and allegations involving potential fraud. The board should also define its own role in 
the investigation process. An organization can improve its chances of loss recovery, while minimizing exposure to 
litigation and damage to reputation, by establishing and preplanning investigation and corrective action processes. 
The board and the organization should establish a process to evaluate allegations. Individuals assigned to 
investigations should have the necessary authority and skills to evaluate the allegation and determine the 
appropriate course of action. The process should include a tracking or case management system where all 
allegations of fraud are logged. Clearly, the board should be actively involved with respect to allegations  
involving senior management.
If further investigation is deemed appropriate as the next course of action, the board should ensure that the 
organization has an appropriate and effective process to investigate cases and maintain confidentiality. A consistent 
process for conducting investigations can help the organization mitigate losses and manage risk associated with the 
investigation. In accordance with policies approved by the board, the investigation team should report its findings to 
the appropriate party, such as senior management, directors, legal counsel, and oversight bodies. Public disclosure 
may also need to be made to law enforcement, regulatory bodies, investors, shareholders, the media, or others.
If certain actions are required before the investigation is complete to preserve evidence, maintain confidence, 
or mitigate losses, those responsible for such decisions should ensure there is sufficient basis for those actions. 
When access to computerized information is required, specialists trained in computer file preservation should be 
used. Actions taken should be appropriate under the circumstances, applied consistently to all levels of employees 
(including senior management), and taken only after consultation with human resources (HR) and individuals 
responsible for such decisions. Consulting legal counsel is also strongly recommended before undertaking an 
investigation and is critical before taking disciplinary, civil, or criminal action. As a matter of good governance, 
management and the board should ensure that the foregoing measures are in place.

Thus, to properly address fraud risk within the organization, principles described in the following sections of this 
paper are needed to make sure: 
• 
Suitable fraud risk management oversight and expectations exist (governance) — Principle 1.
• 
Fraud exposures are identified and evaluated (risk assessment) — Principle 2.
• 
Appropriate processes and procedures are in place to manage these exposures (prevention and detection) 
— Principles 3 & 4.
• 
Fraud allegations are addressed, and appropriate corrective action is taken in a timely manner (investigation 
and corrective action) — Principle 5.9  
SECTION 1: FRAUD RISK GOVERNANCE 
Principle 1: As part of an organization’s governance structure, a fraud risk management program should 
be in place, including a written policy (or policies) to convey the expectations of the board of directors 
and senior management regarding managing fraud risk.
Corporate governance has been defined in many ways, including “The system by which companies are directed 
and controlled,”10 and “The process by which corporations are made responsive to the rights and wishes of 
stakeholders.”11 Corporate governance is also the manner in which management and those charged with oversight 
accountability meet their obligations and fiduciary responsibilities to stakeholders.
Business stakeholders (e.g., shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, governmental entities, community 
organizations, and media) have raised the awareness and expectation of corporate behavior and corporate 
governance practices. Some organizations have developed corporate cultures that encompass strong board 
governance practices, including: 
• 
Board ownership of agendas and information flow.
• 
Access to multiple layers of management and effective control of a whistleblower hotline.
• 
Independent nomination processes. 
• 
Effective senior management team (including chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer, and chief 
operating officer) evaluations, performance management, compensation, and succession planning. 
• 
A code of conduct specific for senior management, in addition to the organization’s code of conduct.
• 
Strong emphasis on the board’s own independent effectiveness and process through board evaluations, 
executive sessions, and active participation in oversight of strategic and risk mitigation efforts. 
These corporate cultures also include board assurance of business ethics considerations in hiring, evaluation, 
promotion, and remuneration policies for employees as well as ethics considerations in all aspects of their 
relationships with customers, vendors, and other business stakeholders. Effective boards and organizations will also

underlying principles of good governance relative to fraud risk management.

address issues of ethics and the impact of ethical behavior on business strategy, operations, and long-term survival. 
The level of board and corporate commitment to these areas varies widely and directly affects the fraud risk profile 
of an organization.  
Effective business ethics programs can serve as the foundation for preventing, detecting, and deterring fraudulent 
and criminal acts. An organization’s ethical treatment of employees, customers, vendors, and other partners will 
influence those receiving such treatment. These ethics programs create an environment where making the right 
decision is implicit. 
The laws of most countries prohibit theft, corruption, and financial statement fraud. Government regulations 
worldwide have increased criminal penalties that can be levied against companies and individuals who participate 
in fraud schemes at the corporate level, and civil settlements brought by shareholders of public companies or 
lenders have rocketed to record amounts12. Market capitalizations of public companies drop dramatically at any 
hint of financial scandal, and likewise, customers punish those firms whose reputations are sullied by indications of 
harmful behavior. Therefore, it should be clear that organizations need to respond to such expectations, and that the 
board and senior management will be held accountable for fraud. In many organizations this is managed as part of 
corporate governance through entity-level controls, including a fraud risk management program13.
Roles and Responsibilities 
To help ensure an organization’s fraud risk management program effective, it is important to understand the roles 
and responsibilities that personnel at all levels of the organization have with respect to fraud risk management. 
Policies, job descriptions, charters, and/or delegations of authority should define roles and responsibilities related 
to fraud risk management. In particular, the documentation should articulate who is responsible for the governance 
oversight of fraud control (i.e., the role and responsibility of the board of directors and/or designated committee of 
the board). Documentation should also reflect management’s responsibility for the design and implementation of 
the fraud risk strategy, and how different segments of the organization support fraud risk management. Fraud risk 
management will often be supported by risk management, compliance, general counsel, the ethics office, security, 
information technology (IT), and internal auditing, or their equivalents. The board of directors, audit committee, 
management, staff, and internal auditing all have key roles in an organization’s fraud risk management program.  
Board of Directors
To set the appropriate tone at the top, the board of directors first should ensure that the board itself is governed 
properly. This encompasses all aspects of board governance, including independent-minded board members 
who exercise control over board information, agenda, and access to management and outside advisers, and 
who independently carry out the responsibilities of the nominating/governance, compensation, audit, and other 
committees. 
12 In the United States and Europe, regulators assessed fines and penalties in excess of US $1 billion for fraudulent and/or criminal behavior 
during 2007. See www.sec.gov.
13 ALARM (The National Forum for Risk Management in the Public Sector (UK)) lists a fraud risk management program as one of five 
essential governance strategies to manage fraud risk. Other strategies include a zero-tolerance culture, a sound counter-fraud and corruption 
framework, strong systems of internal control, and close working relationships with partners regarding fraud risk management activities. 


## Page 13

12
The board also has the responsibility to ensure that management designs effective fraud risk management 
documentation to encourage ethical behavior and to empower employees, customers, and vendors to insist those 
standards are met every day. The board should:
• 
Understand fraud risks. 
• 
Maintain oversight of the fraud risk assessment by ensuring that fraud risk has been considered as part 
of the organization’s risk assessment and strategic plans. This responsibility should be addressed under a 
periodic agenda item at board meetings when general risks to the organization are considered.
• 
Monitor management’s reports on fraud risks, policies, and control activities, which include obtaining 
assurance that the controls are effective. The board also should establish mechanisms to ensure it is 
receiving accurate and timely information from management, employees, internal and external auditors, 
and other stakeholders regarding potential fraud occurrences. 
• 
Oversee the internal controls established by management. 
• 
Set the appropriate tone at the top through the CEO job description, hiring, evaluation, and succession-
planning processes. 
• 
Have the ability to retain and pay outside experts where needed.
• 
Provide external auditors with evidence regarding the board’s active involvement and concern about fraud 
risk management.
The board may choose to delegate oversight of some or all of such responsibilities to a committee of the board. 
These responsibilities should be documented in the board and applicable committee charters. The board should 
ensure it has sufficient resources of its own and approve sufficient resources in the budget and long-range plans to 
enable the organization to achieve its fraud risk management objectives.
Audit Committee (or similar oversight body)14
The audit committee should be composed of independent board members and should have at least one financial 
expert, preferably with an accounting background. The committee should meet frequently enough, for long 
enough periods, and with sufficient preparation to adequately assess and respond to the risk of fraud, especially 
management fraud, because such fraud typically involves override of the organization’s internal controls. It is key 
that the audit committee receive regular reports on the status of reported or alleged fraud.
An audit committee of the board that is committed to a proactive approach to fraud risk management maintains  
an active role in the oversight of the organization’s assessment of fraud risks and uses internal auditors, or  
other designated personnel, to monitor fraud risks. Such a committee also provides the external auditors with  
evidence that the committee is committed to fraud risk management and will discuss with the external auditor the 
auditors’ planned approach to fraud detection as part of the financial statement audit. Management Override of 
Internal Controls: The Achilles’ Heel of Fraud Prevention, an AICPA publication, provides valuable information for 
audit committees that take this approach. 
14 This heading discusses more detailed governance roles, using the audit committee as an illustration. Some organizations may require 
this level of responsibility by the full board, or the board may delegate it to a risk management committee, strategic planning committee, 
etc. Accounting standards and securities regulations in each country provide more detailed guidance as to what is a best practice or legal 
requirement in their jurisdictions.


## Page 14

13
At each audit committee meeting, the committee should meet separately from management with appropriate 
individuals, such as the chief internal audit executive and senior financial person. The audit committee should 
understand how internal and external audit strategies address fraud risk. The audit committee should not only focus 
on what the auditors are doing to detect fraud, but more importantly on what management is doing to prevent  
fraud, where possible.
	
The audit committee should be aware that the organization’s external auditors have a responsibility to plan and 
perform the audit of the organization’s financial statements to obtain reasonable assurance15 about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud. The extent and limitations 
of an external audit are generally governed by the applicable audit standards in place.16 The audit committee  
should insist on openness and honesty with the external auditors. The external auditors should also have 
commitment and cooperation from the audit committee. This includes open and candid dialogue between audit 
committee members and the external auditors regarding the audit committee’s knowledge of any fraud or suspected 
fraud affecting the organization as well as how the audit committee exercises oversight activities with respect to  
the organization’s assessment of the risks of fraud and the programs and controls the organization has established 
to mitigate these risks.
The audit committee should also seek the advice of legal counsel whenever dealing with issues of allegations  
of fraud. Fraud allegations should be taken seriously since there may be a legal obligation to investigate  
and/or report them.
In addition, since reputation risk resulting from fraudulent behavior often has a severe impact on shareholder  
value, the audit committee should provide specific consideration and oversight of this exposure when reviewing  
the work of management and internal auditors, and ask them to be alert for and report such exposure as they  
carry out their duties. 
Management
Management has overall responsibility for the design and implementation of a fraud risk management  
program, including:
• 
Setting the tone at the top for the rest of the organization. As mentioned, an organization’s culture plays an 
important role in preventing, detecting, and deterring fraud. Management needs to create a culture through 
words and actions where it is clear that fraud is not tolerated, that any such behavior is dealt with swiftly 
and decisively, and that whistleblowers will not suffer retribution. 
15 The inherent limitations of an external audit regarding matters related to fraud are described in applicable audit standards. The standards 
acknowledge that owing to the inherent limitations of an external audit, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements of the 
financial statements — particularly those resulting from fraud — will not be detected, even though the external auditor has properly planned 
and performed in accordance with generally accepted standards.
16 Internationally, refer to International Standards on Auditing (ISA) No. 240, The Auditor’s Responsibility to Consider Fraud in an Audit of 
Financial Statements. In the United States, refer to Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 99 (AU sec 316), Consideration of Fraud in 
a Financial Statement Audit; SAS No. 1 (AU sec 1), Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures; PCAOB AS5; and Section 10A of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In Canada, refer to CICA Handbook – Assurance Section 5135, The Auditor’s Responsibility to Consider 
Fraud. One may also refer to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), the International Federation  
of Accountants (IFAC) International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), and the Association of Chartered Certified  
Accountants (ACCA).

• 
Implementing adequate internal controls — including documenting fraud risk management policies and 
procedures and evaluating their effectiveness — aligned with the organization’s fraud risk assessment. 
To conduct a reasonable evaluation, it is necessary to compile information from various areas of the 
organization as part of the fraud risk management program.

Reporting to the board on what actions have been taken to manage fraud risks and regularly reporting on 
the effectiveness of the fraud risk management program. This includes reporting any remedial steps that are 
needed, as well as reporting actual frauds.
Whenever the external auditor has determined that there is evidence that fraud may exist, the external auditor’s 
professional standards require that the matter should be brought to the attention of an appropriate level of 
management.  The external auditor should report fraud involving senior management directly to those charged with 
governance (e.g. the audit committee).  
In many organizations, one executive-level member of management is appointed to be responsible for fraud risk 
management and to report to the board periodically. This executive, a chief ethics officer for instance, is responsible 
for entity-level controls that establish the tone at the top and corporate culture. These expectations are often 
documented in the organization’s values or principles, code of conduct, and related policies; demonstrated through 
executive communications and behaviors; and included in training programs. The person appointed should be 
familiar with the organization’s fraud risks and process-level controls, and is often responsible for the design and 
implementation of the processes used to ensure compliance, reporting, and investigation of alleged violations.
Staff
Strong controls against fraud are the responsibility of everyone in the organization. The importance of internal 
controls in fraud risk management is not a new concept. In 1992, after more than three years of collaboration 
between corporate leaders, legislators, regulators, auditors, academics, and many others, COSO presented a common 
definition of internal controls and provided a framework against which organizations could assess and improve their 
internal control systems. COSO identified five components in its landmark Internal Control–Integrated Framework — 
control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring — that 
may serve as the premise for the design of controls. The elements are deeply intertwined and overlapping in their 
nature, providing a natural interactive process to promote the type of environment in which fraud simply will not be 
tolerated at any level.17  
All levels of staff, including management, should:
• 
Have a basic understanding of fraud and be aware of the red flags.
• 
Understand their roles within the internal control framework. Staff members should understand how their 
job procedures are designed to manage fraud risks and when noncompliance may create an opportunity for 
fraud to occur or go undetected.
• 
Read and understand policies and procedures (e.g. the fraud policy, code of conduct, and whistleblower 
policy), as well as other operational policies and procedures, such as procurement manuals.
17 Appendix I suggests control activities aligned with each COSO component.

• 
As required, participate in the process of creating a strong control environment and designing and 
implementing fraud control activities, as well as participate in monitoring activities.
• 
Report suspicions or incidences of fraud. 
• 
Cooperate in investigations.
Internal Auditing 
The IIA’s Definition of Internal Auditing states, “Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and 
consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organization 
accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness 
of risk management, control, and governance processes.” In relation to fraud, this means that internal auditing 
provides assurance to the board and to management that the controls they have in place are appropriate given the 
organization’s risk appetite.  
Internal auditing should provide objective assurance to the board and management that fraud controls are  
sufficient for identified fraud risks and ensure that the controls are functioning effectively. Internal auditors may 
review the comprehensiveness and adequacy of the risks identified by management — especially with regard to 
management override risks18. 
Internal auditors should consider the organization’s assessment of fraud risk when developing their annual audit 
plan and review management’s fraud management capabilities periodically. They should interview and communicate 
regularly with those conducting the organization’s risk assessments, as well as others in key positions throughout 
the organization, to help them ensure that all fraud risks have been considered appropriately. When performing 
engagements, internal auditors should spend adequate time and attention to evaluating the design and operation 
of internal controls related to fraud risk management. They should exercise professional skepticism when reviewing 
activities and be on guard for the signs of fraud. Potential frauds uncovered during an engagement should be 
treated in accordance with a well-defined response plan consistent with professional and legal standards. Internal 
auditing should also take an active role in support of the organization’s ethical culture.19 
The importance an organization attaches to its internal audit function is an indication of the organization’s 
commitment to effective internal control. The internal audit charter, which is approved by the board or designated 
committee, should include internal auditing’s roles and responsibilities related to fraud. Specific internal audit 
roles in relation to fraud risk management could include initial or full investigation of suspected fraud, root cause 
analysis and control improvement recommendations, monitoring of a reporting/whistleblower hotline, and providing 
ethics training sessions.20 If assigned such duties, internal auditing has a responsibility to obtain sufficient skills 
and competencies, such as knowledge of fraud schemes, investigation techniques, and laws. Effective internal audit 
functions are adequately funded, staffed, and trained, with appropriate specialized skills given the nature, size, 
and complexity of the organization and its operating environment. Internal auditing should be independent (have 
independent authority and reporting relationships), have adequate access to the audit committee, and adhere to 
professional standards.

Communication; as well as the IIA–UK and Ireland Fraud Position Statement.

Fraud Risk Management Program Components
Most organizations have written policies and procedures to manage fraud risks, such as codes of conduct, expense 
account procedures, and incident investigation standards. They usually have some activities that management 
has implemented to assess risks, ensure compliance, identify and investigate violations, measure and report the 
organization’s performance to appropriate stakeholders, and communicate expectations. However, few have 
developed a concise summary of these documents and activities to help them communicate and evaluate their 
processes. We refer to the aggregate of these as the fraud risk management program (“program”), even if the 
organization has not formally designated it as such.
It is management’s prerogative, with oversight from the board, to determine the type and format of documentation 
it wishes to adopt for its program. Suggested formats include:
• 
A single comprehensive and complete document that addresses all aspects of fraud risk management (i.e., a 
fraud control policy21).
• 
A brief strategy outline emphasizing the attributes of fraud control, but leaving the design of specific 
policies and procedures to those responsible for business functions within the organization.
• 
An outline, within a control framework, referencing relevant policies, procedures, plans, programs, reports, 
and responsible positions, developed by the organization’s head office, divisions, or subsidiaries.22
While each organization needs to consider its size and complexity when determining what type of formal 
documentation is most appropriate, the following elements should be found within a fraud risk  
management program:
Commitment 
The board and senior management should communicate their commitment to fraud risk management. One method 
would be to embed this commitment in the organization’s values or principles and code of conduct. Another method 
is issuing a short document (e.g., letter) made available to all employees, vendors, and customers. This summary 
document should stress the importance of fraud risk mitigation, acknowledge the organization’s vulnerability to 
fraud, and establish the responsibility for each person within the organization to support fraud risk management. 
The letter should be endorsed or authored by a senior executive or board member, provided to employees as part 
of their orientation process, and reissued periodically. The letter could serve as the foundation for, and may be the 
executive summary of, a fraud control policy.
Fraud Awareness
An ongoing awareness program is a key enabler to convey fraud risk management expectations, as well as 
an effective preventive control. Awareness of fraud and misconduct schemes is developed through periodic 
21 For examples of fraud control policies, see Appendices B and C.
22 Some organizations centralize fraud risk management information under the chief ethics officer or within a framework used by internal 
auditing or the chief financial officer. Others may have this information spread out across the organization — for example, investigation 
standards and files in legal, hiring and training information in human resources, hotline information in internal auditing, risk assessment in the 
enterprise risk management group — and will need to compile it to do an effective evaluation and to enable concise reporting to the board.

17
assessment, training, and frequent communication. An organization’s fraud risk management program will assist 
the organization with fraud awareness. Documentation to support fraud awareness should define and describe 
fraud and fraud risks.23 It should also provide examples of the types of fraud that could occur and identify potential 
perpetrators of fraud. 
When designing fraud awareness programs, management should consider who should attend, frequency and length, 
cultural sensitivities, guidance on how to solve ethical dilemmas, and delivery methods. Management should also 
consider the training needs of the board or board committee members.
Affirmation Process
An organization should determine whether there are any legal issues involved with having an affirmation process, 
which is the requirement for directors, employees, and contractors to acknowledge they have read, understood, 
and complied with the code of conduct, a fraud control policy, and other such documentation to support the 
organization’s fraud risk management program. There is a fraud risk to the organization of not having an affirmation 
process. This should be acknowledged and accepted at or above a senior management level.
The affirmation process may be handled electronically or via manual signature. Organizations implementing best 
practice often also require personnel to acknowledge that they are not aware of anyone who is in violation of the 
policies. Management should establish consequences for refusal to sign-off and apply such action consistently.
Some organizations include terms in their contracts that require service providers to agree to abide by the 
organization’s code of conduct, a global standard, or the like, which may also prevent fraud. Others require senior 
management to sign a code of conduct specific to employees at higher levels of the organization and require service 
providers to sign separate agreements on specific topics, such as confidentiality or use of company technologies.
Conflict Disclosure
A process should be implemented for directors, employees, and contractors to internally self-disclose potential or 
actual conflicts of interest. Once conflicts are internally disclosed, there are several decision paths:
• 
Management may assert that there is in fact, a conflict and require the individual to terminate the activity 
or leave the organization.
• 
Management may accept the internal disclosure and determine that there is no conflict of interest in the 
situation described.
• 
Management may decide that there is a potential for conflict of interest and may impose certain constraints 
on the individual to manage the identified risk and to ensure there is no opportunity for a conflict to arise.
The disclosure of a potential conflict of interest and management’s decision24 should be documented and disclosed 
to legal counsel. Any constraints placed on the situation need to be monitored. For example, a buyer who has 
23 Refer to Section 2 (Fraud Risk Assessment) for a more detailed discussion of fraud risks and risk assessments.
24 Conflict of interest policy provision waivers for executive officers of New York Stock Exchange-listed companies can only be granted by the 
board of directors or a committee thereof, and such waivers have to be disclosed to shareholders promptly. Waivers for executive officers of 
NASDAQ-listed companies can only be granted by independent board members, and such waivers need to be disclosed.

recently been hired in the purchasing department is responsible for all purchases in Division A. His brother has a 
local hardware store that supplies product to Division A. The buyer discloses the potential conflict of interest and 
is told that transactions with the hardware store are permitted, as long as the department supervisor monitors a 
monthly report of all activity with the hardware store to ensure the activity and price levels are reasonable and 
competitive. When the buyer is promoted or transferred, the constraints may be removed or altered.
Other disclosure processes may also exist, such as insider trading disclosures. Those processes that mitigate  
potential fraud risk should be linked to the fraud risk management program. Organizations should evaluate the  
legal requirements and/or business benefits of disclosing their code of conduct, fraud control policy, or related 
statements to the public.
Fraud Risk Assessment25  
The foundations of an effective fraud risk management program are rooted in a risk assessment, overseen by the 
board, which identifies where fraud may occur within the organization. A fraud risk assessment should be performed 
on a systematic and recurring basis, involve appropriate personnel, consider relevant fraud schemes and scenarios, 
and mapping those fraud schemes and scenarios to mitigating controls. The existence of a fraud risk assessment and 
the fact that management is articulating its existence may even deter would-be fraud perpetrators. 
The system of internal controls in an organization is designed to address inherent business risks. The business risks 
are identified in the enterprise risk assessment protocol, and the controls associated with each risk are noted. 
COSO’s Enterprise Risk Management–Integrated Framework describes the essential ERM components, principles, and 
concepts for all organizations, regardless of size. 
Reporting Procedures and Whistleblower Protection
Documentation should not only articulate the organization’s zero tolerance26 for fraud, it should also establish the 
expectation that suspected fraud must be reported immediately and provide the means to do so. The channels to 
report suspected fraud issues should be clearly defined and communicated. These may be the same or different from 
channels for reporting other code of conduct violations. 
Considering that people commit fraud and that people are an organization’s best asset in preventing, detecting, and 
deterring fraud, an organization should consider promoting available fraud reporting resources that individuals may 
access, such as a fraud or ethics page on the organization’s Web site, an ombudsman, or a whistleblower hotline. 
To encourage timely reporting of suspected issues, the organization should communicate the protections afforded 
to the individual reporting the issue — often referred to as whistleblower protection. In some countries, securities 
regulations require organizations to have whistleblower protection.
25 For more information on fraud risk assessments, refer to Section 2: Fraud Risk Assessment.
26 ALARM (The National Forum for Risk Management in the Public Sector (UK)) lists a culture of zero tolerance as one of five essential 
governance strategies to manage fraud risk. Other strategies include an embedded strategic approach to risk management, a sound counter-
fraud and corruption framework, strong systems of internal control, and close working relationships with partners regarding fraud risk 
management activities.

Investigation Process27
Organizations should require that an investigation process be in place. Once an issue is suspected and reported, an 
investigation process will follow. The board and management should have a documented protocol for this process, 
including consideration of who should conduct the investigation — whether it be internal personnel or hiring 
experts in this field — rules of evidence, chains of custody, reporting mechanisms to those charged with governance, 
regulatory requirements, and legal actions. Organizations should also consider whether to require all employees, as a 
condition of employment, to cooperate fully with an investigation into any alleged or suspected fraud.      
Corrective Action
As a deterrent, policies should reflect the consequences and processes for those who commit or condone fraudulent 
activity. These consequences may include termination of employment or of a contract and reporting to legal and 
regulatory authorities. The organization should articulate that it has the right to institute civil or criminal action 
against anyone who commits fraud.
When fraud does occur within the organization, policies should reflect the need to conduct a postmortem to identify 
the control weakness that contributed to the fraudulent act. The postmortem should lead to a remediation of any 
identified control deficiencies. Internal auditors are important resources for this activity.
Process Evaluation and Improvement (Quality Assurance)
Documentation should describe whether, and/or how, management will periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the 
fraud risk management program and monitor changes. It may include the need for measurements and analysis of 
statistics, benchmarks, resources, and survey results. The results of this evaluation should be reported to appropriate 
oversight groups and be used by management to improve the fraud risk management program.
Continuous Monitoring
The fraud risk management program, including related documents, should be revised and reviewed based on the 
changing needs of the organization, recognizing that documentation is static, while organizations are dynamic. 
Fraud risk management program documentation should be updated on an ongoing basis to reflect current conditions 
and to reflect the organization’s continuing commitment to the fraud risk management program.
SECTION 2: FRAUD RISK ASSESSMENT
Principle 2: Fraud risk exposure should be assessed periodically by the organization to identify specific 
potential schemes and events that the organization needs to mitigate.
Regulators, professional standard-setters, and law enforcement authorities have emphasized the crucial role 
risk assessment plays in developing and maintaining effective fraud risk management programs and controls.28 
27 Refer to Section 5 (Investigation and Corrective Action) for more details on the investigation process and corrective action.
28 Refer to June 2007 SEC Guidance to Management; PCAOB AS5; IIA Practice Advisory 1210-A2-1: Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to

Financial Statement Audit; and ISA No. 240.

Organizations can identify and assess fraud risks in conjunction with an overall enterprise risk assessment or  
on a stand-alone basis.  
Guidance for conducting a fraud risk assessment is provided in this section of the guide. Organizations can tailor this 
approach to meet their individual needs, complexities, and goals.  
The foundation of an effective fraud risk management program should be seen as a component of a larger 
enterprise risk management (ERM) effort and is rooted in a risk assessment that identifies where fraud may occur 
and who the perpetrators might be. To this end, control activities should always consider both the fraud scheme and 
the individuals within and outside the organization who could be the perpetrators of each scheme. If the scheme 
is collusive29, preventive controls should be augmented by detective controls, as collusion negates the control 
effectiveness of segregation of duties.
Fraud, by definition, entails intentional misconduct, designed to evade detection. As such, the fraud risk assessment 
team should engage in strategic reasoning to anticipate the behavior of a potential fraud perpetrator.30 Strategic 
reasoning, which is also important in designing fraud detection procedures that a perpetrator may not expect, 
requires a skeptical mindset and involves asking questions such as: 
• 
How might a fraud perpetrator exploit weaknesses in the system of controls? 
• 
How could a perpetrator override or circumvent controls? 
• 
What could a perpetrator do to conceal the fraud? 
With this in mind, a fraud risk assessment generally includes three key elements: 
• 
Identify inherent fraud risk31 — Gather information to obtain the population of fraud risks that could  
apply to the organization. Included in this process is the explicit consideration of all types of fraud schemes 
and scenarios; incentives, pressures, and opportunities to commit fraud; and IT fraud risks  
specific to the organization.
• 
Assess likelihood and significance of inherent fraud risk — Assess the relative likelihood and potential 
significance of identified fraud risks based on historical information, known fraud schemes, and interviews 
with staff, including business process owners. 
• 
Respond to reasonably likely and significant inherent and residual fraud risks — Decide what the response 
should be to address the identified risks and perform a cost-benefit analysis of fraud risks over which the 
organization wants to implement controls or specific fraud detection procedures.
29 A collusive scheme is one performed by two or more individuals working together.
30 T. Jeffrey Wilks and M.F. Zimbelman, “Using Game Theory and Strategic Reasoning Concepts to Prevent and Detect Fraud,” Accounting 
Horizons, Volume 18, No. 3 (September 2004).
31 The initial assessment of fraud risk should consider the inherent risk of particular frauds occurring in the absence of internal controls. After 
all relevant fraud risks have been identified, internal controls are mapped to the identified risks. Fraud risks that remain unaddressed by 
appropriate controls comprise the population of residual fraud risks.


## Page 22

21
Organizations should apply a framework to document their fraud risk assessment. The framework below illustrates 
how the elements of fraud risk identification, assessment, and response are applied in a rational, structured 
approach. This example begins with a list of identified fraud risks and schemes, which are then assessed for relative 
likelihood and significance of occurrence. Next, the risks and schemes are mapped to the people and/or departments 
that may be impacted and to relevant controls, which are evaluated for design effectiveness and tested to validate 
operating effectiveness. Lastly, residual risks are identified, and a fraud risk response is developed.32

The Risk Assessment Team
A good risk assessment requires input from various sources. Before conducting a risk assessment, management 
should identify a risk assessment team. This team should include individuals from throughout the organization  
with different knowledge, skills, and perspectives and should include a combination of internal and external 
resources such as:
• 
Accounting/finance personnel, who are familiar with the financial reporting process and internal controls. 
• 
Nonfinancial business unit and operations personnel, to leverage their knowledge of day-to-day operations, 
customer and vendor interactions, and general awareness of issues within the industry.
• 
Risk management personnel, to ensure that the fraud risk assessment process integrates with the 
organization’s ERM program. 
• 
Legal and compliance personnel, as the fraud risk assessment will identify risks that give rise to potential 
criminal, civil, and regulatory liability if the fraud or misconduct were to occur. 
• 
Internal audit personnel, who will be familiar with the organization’s internal controls and monitoring 
functions. In addition, internal auditors will be integral in developing and executing responses to significant 
risks that cannot be mitigated practically by preventive and detective controls.
• 
If expertise is not available internally, external consultants with expertise in applicable standards, key risk 
indicators, anti-fraud methodology, control activities, and detection procedures. 
Management, including senior management, business unit leaders, and significant process owners (e.g., accounting, 
sales, procurement, and operations) should participate in the assessment, as they are ultimately accountable for the 
effectiveness of the organization’s fraud risk management efforts.    
Fraud Risk Identification 
Once assembled, the risk assessment team should go through a brainstorming activity to identify the organization’s 
fraud risks. Effective brainstorming involves preparation in advance of the meeting, a leader to set the agenda 
and facilitate the session, and openness to ideas regarding potential risks and controls33. Brainstorming enables 
discussions of the incentives, pressures, and opportunities to commit fraud; risks of management override of 
controls; and the population of fraud risks relevant to the organization.34 Other risks, such as regulatory and legal 
misconduct and reputation risk, as well as the impact of IT on fraud risks also should be considered in the fraud risk 
identification process.
The organization’s fraud risk identification information should be shared with the board or audit committee and 
comments should be solicited. The board also should assess the implications of its own processes with respect to its 
contribution to fraud risk, including incentive pressures.
33 Sources of information about good brainstorming practices include (a) Mark S. Beasley and Gregory Jenkins, “A Primer for Brainstorming 
Fraud Risks,” Journal of Accountancy, December 2003, and (b) Michael J. Ramos, “Brainstorming Prior to the Audit,” in Fraud Detection in a 
GAAS Audit: Revised Edition, Chapter 2: “Considering Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit.” 
34 Refer to Appendix E: Fraud Risk Exposures of this document for a list of potential fraud risk which could be used in brainstorming.


## Page 24

23
Incentives, Pressures, and Opportunities
Motives for committing fraud are numerous and diverse. One executive may believe that the organization’s business 
strategy will ultimately be successful, but interim negative results need to be concealed to give the strategy time. 
Another needs just a few more pennies per share of income to qualify for a bonus or to meet analysts’ estimates. 
The third executive purposefully understates income to save for a rainy day.
The fraud risk identification process should include an assessment of the incentives, pressures, and opportunities to 
commit fraud. Incentive programs should be evaluated — by the board for senior management and by management 
for others — as to how they may affect employees’ behavior when conducting business or applying professional 
judgment (e.g., estimating bad debt allowances or revenue recognition). Financial incentives and the metrics on 
which they are based can provide a map to where fraud is most likely to occur. There may also be nonfinancial 
incentives, such as when an employee records a fictitious transaction so he or she does not have to explain an 
otherwise unplanned variance. Even maintaining the status quo is sometimes a powerful enough incentive for 
personnel to commit fraud. 
Also important, and often harder to quantify, are the pressures on individuals to achieve performance or other 
targets. Some organizations are transparent, setting specific targets and metrics on which personnel will be 
measured. Other organizations are more indirect and subtle, relying on corporate culture to influence behavior. 
Individuals may not have any incremental monetary incentive to fraudulently adjust a transaction, but there may be 
ample pressure — real or perceived — on an employee to act fraudulently. 
Meanwhile, opportunities to commit fraud exist throughout organizations and may be reason enough to commit 
fraud. These opportunities are greatest in areas with weak internal controls and a lack of segregation of duties. 
However, some frauds, especially those committed by management, may be difficult to detect because management 
can often override the controls. Such opportunities are why appropriate monitoring of senior management by a 
strong board and audit committee, supported by internal auditing, is critical to fraud risk management.
Risk of Management’s Override of Controls
As part of the risk identification process, it is important to consider the potential for management override of 
controls established to prevent or detect fraud. Personnel within the organization generally know the controls and 
standard operating procedures that are in place to prevent fraud. It is reasonable to assume that individuals who 
are intent on committing fraud will use their knowledge of the organization’s controls to do it in a manner that 
will conceal their actions. For example, a manager who has the authority to approve new vendors may create and 
approve a fictitious vendor and then submit invoices for payment, rather than just submit false invoices for payment. 
Hence, it is also important to keep the risk of management’s override of controls in mind when evaluating the 
effectiveness of controls; an anti-fraud control is not effective if it can be overridden easily.
Population of Fraud Risks
The fraud risk identification process requires an understanding of the universe of fraud risks and the subset of risks 
specific to the organization. This may involve obtaining information from external sources such as industry news; 
criminal, civil, and regulatory complaints and settlements; and organizations such as The IIA, AICPA, ACFE, and CICA. 


## Page 25

24
This also involves understanding the organization’s business processes and gathering information about potential 
fraud from internal sources by interviewing personnel and brainstorming with them, reviewing complaints from the 
whistleblower hotline, and performing analytical procedures.    
Various taxonomies are available to organize fraud risks. Appendix H displays the Foundation Principles issued by 
the Open Compliance and Ethics Group (OCEG) that relate to fraud risk identification. The ACFE, on the other hand, 
classifies occupational fraud risks into three general categories: fraudulent statements, misappropriation of assets, 
and corruption35. Using the ACFE’s categories as a starting point, a more detailed breakout can be developed to 
produce an organization-specific fraud risk assessment. For example, potential fraud risks to consider in the ACFE’s 
three general categories include:
1)	 Intentional manipulation of financial statements, which can lead to: 
a)	 Inappropriately reported revenues.
b)	 Inappropriately reported expenses.
c) Inappropriately reflected balance sheet amounts, including reserves.
d)	 Inappropriately improved and/or masked disclosures.
e)	 Concealing misappropriation of assets.
f)	
Concealing unauthorized receipts and expenditures.
g)	 Concealing unauthorized acquisition, disposition, and use of assets.
2)	 Misappropriation of:
a)	 Tangible assets by:
i)	
Employees. 
ii)	 Customers.
iii)	 Vendors.
iv)	 Former employees and others outside the organization.
b)	 Intangible assets.
c)	 Proprietary business opportunities. 
3)	 Corruption including:
a)	 Bribery and gratuities to:
i)	
Companies.
ii)	 Private individuals.
iii)	 Public officials. 
b)	 Receipt of bribes, kickbacks, and gratuities.
c)	 Aiding and abetting fraud by other parties (e.g., customers, vendors).
Fraudulent Financial Reporting 
Each of the three categories outlined by the ACFE includes at least one scheme of how the fraud could occur. 
For instance, acceleration of revenue recognition can be achieved via numerous schemes, including backdating 
agreements, recognizing revenue on product not shipped by period end, or channel stuffing. Some fraudulent 
35 The ACFE’s Report to the Nation on Occupational Fraud and Abuse.


## Page 26

25
financial reporting schemes are common across all organizations (e.g., setting aside unsupported reserves for 
use in future periods and fraudulent top-side entries); other schemes are more industry-specific (e.g., backdating 
agreements at software companies or channel stuffing for organizations that sell via distributors). Each scheme that 
could be relevant to the organization should be considered in the assessment.  
Organizations can use the framework in Appendix D to identify specific areas of greatest risk and as a foundation 
for customizing the assessment process for their specific needs. For example, starting with the revenue recognition 
component of fraudulent financial reporting, the assessment should consider the following questions: 
• 
What are the main drivers of revenue at the organization?  
• 
Are revenues primarily from volume sales of relatively homogeneous products, or are they driven by a 
relatively few individual transactions? 
• 
What are the incentives and pressures present in the organization?
• 
Are revenues recorded systematically or manually?
• 
Are there any revenue recognition fraud risks specific to the organization’s industry?
For significant marketplace disclosures (e.g., loan delinquency percentages) consider the following questions: 
• 
What controls are in place to monitor internal gathering and reporting of these disclosures?  
• 
Is there oversight from someone whose compensation is not directly affected by his or her performance?  
• 
Does someone monitor the organization’s disclosures in relation to other organizations and ask hard 
questions about whether the organization’s disclosures are adequate or could be improved?
The types of fraudulent financial reporting outlined by the ACFE typically focus on improving the organization’s 
financial picture by overstating income, understating losses, or using misleading disclosures. Conversely, some 
organizations understate income to smooth earnings. Any intentional misstatement of accounting information 
represents fraudulent financial reporting.
Another consideration involves fraud where the objective is not to improve the organization’s financial statements, 
but to cover up a hole left by the misappropriation or misuse of assets. In this case, the fraud also includes 
fraudulent financial reporting. 
Misappropriation of Assets 
An organization’s assets, both tangible (e.g., cash or inventory) and intangible (e.g., proprietary or confidential 
product, or customer information), can be misappropriated by employees, customers, or vendors. The organization 
should ensure that controls are in place to protect such assets. Considerations to be made in the fraud risk 
assessment process include gaining an understanding of what assets are subject to misappropriation, the locations 
where the assets are maintained, and which personnel have control over or access to tangible or intangible assets. 
Common schemes include misappropriation by:
• 
Employees.
-	
Creation of, and payments to, fictitious vendors.
- 
Payment of inflated or fictitious invoices.

-	
Invoices for goods not received or services not performed.
-	
Theft of inventory or use of business assets for personal gain.
- 
False or inflated expense claims.
-	
Theft or use of customer lists and proprietary information. 
• 
Employees in collusion with vendors, customers, or third parties.
- 
Payment of inflated or fictitious invoices.
- 
Issuance of inflated or fictitious credit notes.
-	
Invoices for goods not received or services not performed.
-	
Preferred pricing or delivery.
-	
Contract bid rigging.
-	
Theft or use of customer lists and proprietary information.
• 
Vendors.
- 
Inflated or fictitious invoices.
-	
Short shipments or substitution of lower quality goods.
-	
Invoices for goods not received or services not preformed.
• 
Customers.
-	
False claims for damaged or returned goods or short shipments.
Protecting against these risks requires not only physical safeguarding controls, but also periodic detective controls 
such as physical counts of inventory with reconciliations to the general ledger. Remember, a smart perpetrator may 
be thinking about such controls and design the fraud to circumvent or be concealed from those controls. Those 
conducting the risk assessment should keep this in mind when deliberating misappropriation of asset schemes and 
their impact to the organization.
Corruption 
 
Corruption is operationally defined as the misuse of entrusted power for private gain. In the United States, the  
FCPA prohibits U.S. entities, their foreign subsidiaries, and others from bribing foreign government officials,  
either directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business. There are similar anti-corruption laws in other countries 
as well as guidelines established by the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, to which more than 100 
countries are signatories. 
Organizations that have operations outside their home countries need to consider other relevant anti-corruption 
laws when establishing a fraud risk management program. Transparency International, a multinational organization 
focused on anti-corruption and transparency in business and government,  issues an annual Corruption Perception 
Index, which ranks countries on their perceived levels of corruption. The Corruption Perception Index can 
assist organizations in prioritizing their anti-corruption efforts in areas of the world at greatest risk. It must be 
remembered, of course, that corruption can also occur in an organization’s home country.
A common form of corruption is aiding and abetting. Law enforcement authorities worldwide have prosecuted 
numerous cases where organizations were not misstating their financial statements, but were knowingly structuring 
transactions or making representations that enabled other organizations to fraudulently misstate their financial 
statements. A thorough risk assessment will consider the risk that someone may be engaging in such behavior as 
well as other types of corruption that may be applicable to the organization.

Information Technology and Fraud Risk  
Organizations rely on IT to conduct business, communicate, and process financial information. A poorly designed 
or inadequately controlled IT environment can expose an organization to fraud. Today’s computer systems, linked 
by national and global networks, face an ongoing threat of cyber fraud and a variety of threats that can result in 
significant financial and information losses. IT is an important component of any risk assessment, especially when 
considering fraud risks.  IT risks include threats to data integrity, threats from hackers to system security, and theft of 
financial and sensitive business information. Whether in the form of hacking, economic espionage, Web defacement, 
sabotage of data, viruses, or unauthorized access to data, IT fraud risks can affect everyone. In fact, IT can be used 
by people intent on committing fraud in any of the three occupational fraud risk areas defined by the ACFE.  
Examples of those risks by area include: 
Fraudulent Financial Reporting 
• 
Unauthorized access to accounting applications — Personnel with inappropriate access to the general 
ledger, subsystems, or the financial reporting tool can post fraudulent entries.
• 
Override of system controls — General computer controls include restricted system access, restricted 
application access, and program change controls. IT personnel may be able to access restricted data or 
adjust records fraudulently. 
Misappropriation of Assets
• 
Theft of tangible assets — Individuals who have access to tangible assets (e.g., cash, inventory,  and fixed 
assets) and to the accounting systems that track and record activity related to those assets can use IT to 
conceal their theft of assets. For example, an individual may establish a fictitious vendor in the vendor 
master file to facilitate the payment of false invoices, or someone may steal inventory and charge the cost 
of sales account for the stolen items, thus removing the asset from the balance sheet.
• 
Theft of intangible assets — Given the transition to a services-based, knowledge economy, more and more 
valuable assets of organizations are intangibles such as customer lists, business practices, patents, and 
copyrighted material. Examples of theft of intangible assets include piracy of software or other copyrighted 
material by individuals either inside or outside of the organization.
Corruption
• 
Misuse of customer data — Personnel within or outside the organization can obtain employee or customer 
data and use such information to obtain credit or for other fraudulent purposes.
Keep in mind, cyber fraudsters do not even have to leave their homes to commit fraud, as they can route 
communications through local phone companies, long-distance carriers, Internet service providers, and wireless and 
satellite networks. They may go through computers located in several countries before attacking targeted systems 
around the globe. What is important is that any information — not just financial — is at risk, and the stakes are very 
high and rising as technology continues to evolve.  
To manage the ever-growing risks of operating in the information age, an organization should know its 
vulnerabilities and be able to mitigate risk in a cost-effective manner. Therefore, IT risk should be incorporated  
into an organization’s overall fraud risk assessment.

Other Risks 
Regulatory and Legal Misconduct 
Regulatory and legal misconduct includes a wide range of risks, such as conflicts of interest, insider trading, theft of 
competitor trade secrets, anti-competitive practices, environmental violations, and trade and customs regulations in 
areas of import/export. Depending on the particular organization and the nature of its business, some or all of these 
risks may be applicable and should be considered in the risk assessment process. 
Reputation Risk 
Reputation risk is evaluated differently by different individuals, either as a separate risk or the end result of other 
risks (e.g., operational, regulatory, or financial reporting). Fraudulent acts can damage an organization’s reputation 
with customers, suppliers, and the capital markets. For example, fraud leading to a financial restatement damages 
an organization’s reputation in the capital markets, which could increase the organization’s cost of borrowing and 
depress its market capitalization. Because the board is responsible for the longevity of the organization and has 
responsibilities to multiple stakeholders, it should evaluate its performance regularly with respect to reputation risks 
and ensure that consideration of reputation risk is part of the organization’s risk assessment process.
Assessment of the Likelihood and Significance  
of Identified Inherent Fraud Risks
Assessing the likelihood and significance of each potential fraud risk is a subjective process. All fraud risks are 
not equally likely, nor will all frauds have a significant impact on every organization. Assessing the likelihood and 
significance of identified inherent risks allows the organization to manage its fraud risks and apply preventive and 
detective procedures rationally.  It is important to first consider fraud risks to the business on an inherent basis, 
or without consideration of known controls. By taking this approach, management will be better able to consider 
all relevant fraud risks and design controls to address the risks. After mapping fraud risks to relevant controls, 
certain residual risks will remain, including the risk of management’s override of established controls. Management 
must evaluate the potential significance of those residual risks and decide on the nature and extent of the fraud 
preventive and detective controls and procedures to address such risks. 
Likelihood — Management’s assessment of the likelihood of a fraud risk occurring is informed by instances of 
that particular fraud occurring in the past at the organization, the prevalence of the fraud risk in the organization’s 
industry, and other factors, including the number of individual transactions, the complexity of the risk, and the 
number of people involved in reviewing or approving the process. Organizations can categorize the likelihood of 
potential frauds occurring in as many buckets as deemed reasonable, but three categories are generally adequate: 
remote, reasonably possible, and probable.  
Significance — Management’s assessment of the significance of a fraud risk should include not only financial 
statement and monetary significance, but also significance to an organization’s operations, brand value, and 
reputation, as well as criminal, civil, and regulatory liability. For example, two different organizations may have 
similar amounts of expenses charged via employee expense reports, but one organization is a professional  
services firm that charges those expenses to clients. Although the likelihood of the risk of fraudulent expense  


## Page 30

29
reports and the monetary exposure may be similar at both organizations, the relative significance of fraudulent 
expense reports to the professional services firm may be greater, given the impact that fraudulent expense 
reports can have on customer relationships. Organizations can categorize the significance of potential frauds in 
as many buckets as deemed reasonable, but three categories are generally adequate: inconsequential, more than 
inconsequential, and material.
People/department — As part of the risk assessment process, the organization will have evaluated the incentives 
and pressures on individuals and departments and should use the information gained in that process to assess 
which individuals or departments are most likely to have incentive to commit a fraudulent act, and, if so, via what 
means. This information can be summarized into the fraud risk assessment grid and can help the organization design 
appropriate risk responses, if necessary. 
Response to Residual Fraud Risks 
Risk tolerance varies from organization to organization. At the highest level, the board sets the organization’s risk 
tolerance level, taking into consideration its responsibilities to all shareholders, capital providers, and stakeholders. 
While some organizations want only to address fraud risks that could have a material financial statement impact, 
other organizations want to have a more robust fraud response program. Many organizations will state that there 
is a “zero tolerance” policy with respect to fraud. However, there may be certain fraud risks that an organization 
considers too expensive and time-consuming to address via controls. Consequently, the organization may decide not 
to put controls in place to address such risks. If a fraud is discovered, zero tolerance for fraud will be applied.  
An organization’s risk tolerance level provides management support on how to respond to fraud risk.  Fraud risks 
can be addressed by accepting the risk of a fraud based on the perceived level of likelihood and significance, 
increasing the controls over the area to mitigate the risk, or designing internal audit procedures to address specific 
fraud risks. The board should ensure management has implemented the right level of controls based on the risk 
tolerance it has established for the organization. In effect, one should look at an organization’s financial statements 
and operations and ask “What can be wrong in this picture?”, and then design appropriate controls. The key is  
to be selective and efficient. There are probably thousands of potential controls that could be put in place. The  
goal is a targeted and structured approach — not an unstructured or haphazard approach — and efficient  
controls that deliver the most benefit for the cost of resources. The overall objective is to have the benefit of  
controls exceed their cost.
In addressing fraud risks, one should be careful to ensure that anti-fraud controls are operating effectively and 
have been designed to include appropriate steps to deal with the relevant risks. Where an internal control might 
be executed with limited skepticism (e.g., agreeing an accrual balance to underlying support) an anti-fraud control 
would include an evaluation of the underlying support for consistency in application from prior periods and for 
potential inappropriate bias. Therefore, anti-fraud controls should be designed appropriately and executed by 
competent and objective individuals. Management’s documentation of anti-fraud controls should include the 
description of what the control is designed to do, who is to perform the control, who is to monitor and assess the 
effectiveness of the control, and the related segregation of duties.

SECTION 3: FRAUD PREVENTION
Principle 3: Prevention techniques to avoid potential key fraud risk events should be established, where 
feasible, to mitigate possible impacts on the organization.
Despite the best efforts of those responsible for preventing fraud, one inevitable reality remains: “fraud happens.” 
Because fraud and misconduct can occur at various levels in any organization, it is essential that appropriate 
preventive and detective techniques are in place. Although fraud prevention and detection are related concepts, 
they are not the same. While prevention encompasses policies, procedures, training, and communication, detection 
involves activities and programs designed to identify fraud or misconduct that is occurring or has occurred.  
Although preventive measures cannot ensure that fraud will not be committed, they are the first line of defense 
in minimizing fraud risk. This section of the guide will cover preventive techniques. Detective techniques will be 
covered in Section 4.   
One key to prevention is making personnel throughout the organization aware of the fraud risk management 
program, including the types of fraud and misconduct that may occur. This awareness should enforce the notion that 
all of the techniques established in the program are real and will be enforced. The ongoing communication efforts 
could provide information on the potential disciplinary, criminal, and civil actions that the organization could take 
against the individual. 
With this in mind, prevention and deterrence are interrelated concepts. If effective preventive controls are in place, 
working, and well-known to potential fraud perpetrators, they serve as strong deterrents to those who might 
otherwise be tempted to commit fraud. Fear of getting caught is always a strong deterrent. Effective preventive 
controls are, therefore, strong deterrence controls.
The system of internal controls in an organization is designed to address inherent business risks. The business risks 
are identified in the enterprise risk assessment protocol, and the controls associated with each risk are noted. 
COSO’s Enterprise Risk Management–Integrated Framework describes the essential ERM components, principles, and 
concepts for all organizations, regardless of size. 
Establishing internal controls may not address all of an organization’s fraud risks. Fraud risks, although a form of 
business risk, necessitate specific controls to mitigate them, which makes an organization’s fraud risk assessment 
process essential to fraud prevention. In addition to implementing fraud preventive controls, it is important that the 
organization assess and continuously monitor their operational effectiveness to help prevent fraud from occurring.
Fraud Preventive Controls 
Prevention is the most proactive fraud-fighting measure. The design and implementation of control activities should 
be a coordinated effort spearheaded by management with an assembled cast of employees. Collectively, this cross 
section of the organization should be able to address all of the identified risks, design and implement the control 
activities, and ensure that the techniques used are adequate to prevent fraud from occurring in accordance with the 
organization’s risk tolerance.


## Page 32

31
The ongoing success of any fraud prevention program depends on its continuous communication and reinforcement. 
Stressing the existence of a fraud prevention program through a wide variety of media — posters on bulletin  
boards, flyers included with invoices and vendor payments, and articles in internal and external communications — 
gets the message out to both internal and external communities that the organization is committed to preventing 
and deterring fraud. 
Among the many elements in fraud prevention are HR procedures, authority limits, and transaction level procedures.  
Human Resources Procedures
An organization’s HR function can play an important role in fraud prevention by implementing the following 
procedures. 
Performing Background Investigations
A key business and fraud risk in any organization lies in the people hired to operate the business and promoted 
into positions of trust and authority. For that reason, it is important to know employees in order to evaluate 
their credentials and competence, match skills to the job requirements, and be aware of any issues of personal 
integrity that may impact their suitability for the position. Much can be learned about an individual through 
confirmation of work history and education presented on a job application or résumé or in follow-up with 
references provided. It is possible to find false or embellished information or undisclosed history and reputation 
that may represent increased, and possibly unacceptable, risk.
While the organization should establish procedures to obtain sufficient information to assess a job applicant or 
promotion candidate, the nature and extent of information that can be requested from a prospective or existing 
employee or obtained independently is governed by applicable laws and regulations. Further or enhanced 
background checking for criminal record or personal financial situation may only be possible upon receiving the 
individual’s consent. Legal counsel should be sought to advise on what background information can and cannot 
be obtained and the appropriate procedures to follow. 
Background checks should also be performed on new and existing suppliers, customers, and business 
partners to identify any issues of financial health, ownership, reputation, and integrity that may represent an 
unacceptable risk to the business.
Anti-fraud Training
 An organization can hire or promote competent individuals who, having undergone appropriate background 
checks, represent a low fraud risk. It is possible that such individuals have a comprehensive understanding of 
what fraud is and what its red flags are, and an appreciation of its potential to devastate an organization. There 
should not, however, be any exemption from receiving an initial orientation and ongoing education on the fraud 
risk management program in place, regardless of the individual’s position in the organization. Such education 
serves to establish and reinforce the tone from the top regarding the individual’s responsibility and the process 
to deal with suspected fraud.


## Page 33

32
An organization’s HR group is often responsible for developing and providing the necessary training on the 
purpose of the fraud risk management program, including the codes of conduct and ethics, what constitutes 
fraud, and what to do when fraud is suspected. The effectiveness of this training is dependent on mandatory 
attendance with periodic updates and refresher sessions.
Evaluating Performance and Compensation Programs
HR managers should be involved in both the performance management and compensation programs. 
Performance management involves the evaluation of employee behavior and performance as well as work-
related competence. It is a human trait to want recognition of competence and reward for positive performance 
and success. Regular and robust assessment of employee performance with timely and constructive feedback 
goes a long way to preventing potential problems. Employees who are not recognized for what they do and 
what they have accomplished, especially those who may have been bypassed for promotion, may feel their 
inappropriate and fraudulent conduct is justified.
Reward can also be reflected in compensation. By conducting compensation surveys and local market analysis, 
HR can determine whether senior management and employees are compensated appropriately and therefore 
driving desired behavior by striking a balance between fixed and variable compensation. Managers whose 
compensation is largely based on short-term performance-related bonuses may be motivated to cut corners or 
deliberately fabricate financial results to achieve those bonuses. 
Conducting Exit Interviews
A policy of conducting exit interviews of terminated employees or those who have resigned can help in both 
prevention and detection efforts. These interviews may help HR managers determine whether there are issues 
regarding management’s integrity or information regarding conditions conducive to fraud. HR should also 
review the content and information contained in resignation letters as they may contain information regarding 
possible fraud and misconduct existing within the organization.  
Authority Limits
Fraud is less likely when an individual’s level of authority is commensurate with his or her level of responsibility. A 
misalignment between authority and responsibility, particularly in the absence of control activities and segregation 
of duties, can lead to fraud. 
An organization may establish authoritative approval levels across the enterprise to serve as an entity-level control. 
On the other hand, individuals working within a specific function may be assigned only limited IT access as a 
process-level control. These types of controls, supported by an appropriate segregation of duties, assist in the first 
line of defense in fraud prevention. 
Transaction-level Procedures
Reviews of third-party and related-party transactions can also help prevent fraud. Because fraud schemes often 
involve the use of third-party entities/individuals, organizations need thorough measures at the front-end that  


## Page 34

33
will prevent the back-end activities. False vendors or employees are two of the more obvious and noted schemes  
in this arena.
Preventive measures are especially needed for related-party transactions that can be controlled by board members 
or by employees of authority with an interest in an outside entity with which the organization may conduct business. 
Such individuals may mandate transactions that ultimately benefit them at the expense of the organization.
Documentation of Fraud Prevention Techniques
An organization should formally document the techniques developed and implemented to prevent fraud. This 
includes documenting processes used to monitor the performance of fraud preventive controls or to indicate when 
such controls are ineffective. Testing procedures conducted to ensure adequate operation of fraud preventive 
controls and the test results should also be thoroughly documented.
	
Paramount to this documentation is a detailed description of the elements of the organization’s fraud prevention 
techniques, with emphasis placed on the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. 
Assessing the Organization’s Fraud Prevention 
Organizations just beginning to assess their fraud risk management program, as well as organizations striving 
to improve their fraud risk management program, should conduct overall assessments of their fraud prevention 
techniques. The Fraud Prevention Scorecard in Appendix F can be used to assess how comprehensive the 
organization’s preventive controls are and how well they are working. Organizations should periodically reassess 
their fraud prevention techniques to ensure that progress is being made to get to an “all-green” fraud prevention 
status and that no elements of fraud prevention are deteriorating. Organizations with strong commitments to fraud 
prevention may also wish to engage independent outside experts to assess their fraud prevention techniques.
Continuous Monitoring of Fraud Preventive Controls
The organization’s plan, approach, and scope of monitoring its fraud prevention techniques should be documented 
and updated as necessary. With all of the parties involved in the risk assessment process and the subsequent design 
of the control activities, it is difficult to require that fraud prevention be monitored regularly by an independent 
entity. But reviews should be conducted separately from any routine or planned audits and should be designed to 
assure management of the effectiveness of the organization’s fraud prevention. 
Before each program review, issues such as significant changes in the organization and their associated risks, 
changes in personnel responsible for implementing the activities, and the results of previous assessments will 
determine if the scope of the current examination needs to be altered. Each evaluation should include evidence that 
management is actively retaining responsibility for oversight of the fraud risk management program, that timely 
and sufficient corrective measures have been taken with respect to any previously noted control deficiencies or 
weaknesses, and that the plan for monitoring the program continues to be adequate for ensuring the program’s 
ongoing success.


## Page 35

34
SECTION 4: FRAUD DETECTION
Principle 4: Detection techniques should be established to uncover fraud events when preventive 
measures fail or unmitigated risks are realized.
Having effective detective controls in place and visible is one of the strongest deterrents to fraudulent behavior. 
Used in tandem with preventive controls, detective controls enhance a fraud risk management program’s 
effectiveness by providing evidence that preventive controls are working as intended and identifying fraud that 
occurs. Although detective controls may provide evidence that fraud is occurring or has occurred, they are not 
intended to prevent fraud. 
In some cases, the types of detective controls implemented may depend on the fraud risks identified for an 
organization. For example, if an organization operates in countries that are identified as having high risks for 
corruption, it may implement detective controls to identify possible violations of the FCPA, such as a recurring 
review of expense reports or consulting fees. Similarly, if an organization has a high frequency of subjective 
estimates, it may implement detective controls related to regular internal audit review of such activity. Overall, 
additional detection controls may be necessary based on the fraud risks identified for the organization. As with fraud 
prevention, it is important that the organization assess and continuously monitor its fraud detection techniques to 
help detect fraud that is occurring or has occurred.
Fraud Detective Controls
Organizations can never eliminate the risk of fraud entirely. There are always people who are motivated to commit 
fraud, and an opportunity can arise for someone in any organization to override a control or collude with others to 
do so. Therefore, detection techniques should be flexible, adaptable, and continuously changing to meet the various 
changes in risk. 
While preventive measures are apparent and readily identifiable by employees, third parties, and others, detective 
controls are clandestine in nature. This means they operate in a background that is not evident in the everyday 
business environment. Such techniques will usually:
• 
Occur in the ordinary course of business.
• 
Draw on external information to corroborate internally generated information.
• 
Formally and automatically communicate identified deficiencies and exceptions to appropriate leadership.
• 
Use results to enhance and modify other controls.
Although every organization is susceptible to fraud, it is not cost-effective to try to eliminate all fraud risk. An 
organization may choose to design its controls to detect, rather than prevent, certain fraud risks, as approved by the 
board. If the estimated costs of designing, implementing, and monitoring the controls against fraud — such as tools, 
personnel, or training — exceeds the estimated impact of the risk, they may not be cost-effective to implement. For 
example, a property and casualty insurance company may set threshold limits on the total of losses paid plus those 
reserved on large policies to identify that fraud may be occurring, rather than relying solely on the identification 
of fraudulent individual claims. Important detection methods include an anonymous reporting mechanism 


## Page 36

35
(whistleblower hotline), process controls, and proactive fraud detection procedures specifically designed to identify 
fraudulent activity.
Whistleblower Hotlines
The use of a whistleblower hotline36, which has markedly increased among SEC registrants since it was mandated by 
the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is one of the more effective measures organizations can implement as part of 
their fraud risk assessment program. Various surveys37 indicate that anonymous tips received through hotlines or by 
other methods are the most likely means of detecting fraud. In addition, knowledge that an employee hotline is in 
place can help prevent fraud because individuals may fear that a fraud will be discovered and reported. 
Marketing the existence of a hotline to increase awareness, making it easy to use, and promoting the timely 
handling of all reported issues are strong preventive measures that should supplement the detective control 
of hotlines. The hotline should be promoted with educational materials provided to shareholders, employees, 
customers, and vendors, all of whom can provide valuable information from a variety of reliable sources. Hotlines 
ideally support a multilingual capability and provide access to a trained interviewer 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Provision for anonymity to any individual who willingly comes forward to report a suspicion of fraud is a key 
to encouraging such reporting and should be a component of the organization’s policy. The most effective 
whistleblower hotlines preserve the confidentiality of callers and provide assurance to employees that they will not 
be retaliated against for reporting their suspicions of wrongdoing including wrongdoing by their superiors. Another 
key is demonstrating that their reporting will result in appropriate and timely action being taken. To preserve the 
integrity of the whistleblower process, it must also provide a means of reporting suspected fraud that involves senior 
management, possibly reporting directly to the audit committee.
A single case management system should be used to log all calls and their follow-up to facilitate management of 
the resolution process, testing by internal auditors, and oversight by the board and/or the audit committee38 as the 
board’s designee. The board should approve protocols to ensure reported fraud-related issues are disseminated 
timely to appropriate parties, such as the ethics/compliance team, HR, the board and/or the audit committee, legal, 
and security. Distributing reports to these parties of occurrences in their respective areas of responsibility ensures 
that no single person or functional area controls this highly sensitive information and increases accountability. 
Charged with the responsibility for having documented procedures for receiving, retaining, and investigating 
complaints or tips alleging the possibility of misconduct or possible fraud, many audit committees have turned to 
independent service providers to operate hotlines and notify the organization of any reported accusations.
 
An effective hotline program should analyze the data received and compare results to norms for similar 
organizations. Ongoing analysis allows an organization to reshape its fraud risk management program to address 
evolving risks. The whistleblower process should be independently evaluated periodically for effectiveness, including 
compliance with established protocols.
36 Whistleblower hotlines may not be legal or ethical, or may be subject to restrictions in some countries outside the United States. As such, 
multinational organizations may not be able to implement hotlines on a worldwide basis.  
37 The ACFE Occupational Fraud and Abuse Survey and the KPMG Fraud Survey are examples.  
38 The United Kingdom (UK) report, “Audit Committees Combined Code Guidance,” by Sir Robert Smith, suggests that audit committees should 
review whistleblowing arrangements regarding the appropriate and independent investigations and follow-up action. 


## Page 37

36
Process Controls
 
Process controls specifically designed to detect fraudulent activity, as well as errors, include reconciliations, 
independent reviews, physical inspections/counts, analyses, and audits. A lack of, or weakness in, preventive controls 
increases the risk of fraud and places a greater burden on detective controls. The more significant the fraud risk, the 
more sensitive to occurrence (e.g., use of thresholds, performance frequency, and population tested) the detective 
control should be.
The nature of fraud risks is such that there should be a systematic identification of the types of fraud schemes 
that can be perpetrated against or within the organization to identify the process controls needed to reduce and 
control the risks. Each industry is susceptible to different types of fraud schemes. The assessment becomes more 
cumbersome in organizations that span different industries. Organizations with multiple divisions/business units 
will need to first perform a broad organizationwide assessment and then perform more detailed and focused 
assessments of individual business units to identify the necessary process controls to detect fraud. 
Proactive Fraud Detection Procedures
 
In addition to detective process controls, organizations may be able to use data analysis, continuous auditing 
techniques, and other technology tools effectively to detect fraudulent activity. Data analysis uses technology to 
identify anomalies, trends, and risk indicators within large populations of transactions. Users of this technology 
may be able to drill down into journal entries looking for suspicious transactions occurring at the end of a period or 
those that were made in one period and later reversed in the next period. These tools may also allow users to look 
for journal entries posted to revenue or expense accounts that improve net income to meet analysts’ expectations 
or incentive compensation targets. Moreover, data analysis allows users to identify relationships among people, 
organizations, and events. 
 
Proactive consideration of how certain fraud schemes may result in identifiable types of transactions or trends 
enhances an organization’s ability to design and implement effective data analysis. Data analytics can also be used 
to cost-effectively ensure the effectiveness of other fraud preventive and detective controls.
Continuous auditing is the use of data analytics on a continuous or real-time basis, thereby allowing management or 
auditing to identify and report fraudulent activity more rapidly. For example, a Benford’s Law analysis39 can examine 
expense reports, general ledger accounts, and payroll accounts for unusual transactions, amounts, or patterns of 
activity that may require further analysis. Similarly, continuous monitoring of transactions subject to certain “flags” 
may promote quicker investigation of higher-risk transactions. 
Technology tools enhance the ability of management at all levels to detect fraud. Data analysis, data mining, and 
digital analysis tools can:
• 
Identify hidden relationships among people, organizations, and events.
• 
Identify suspicious transactions.
• 
Assess the effectiveness of internal controls.
39 Benford’s Law analysis is a process of comparing actual results vs. expected results by looking for unusual transactions that do not fit an 
expected pattern.


## Page 38

37
• 
Monitor fraud threats and vulnerabilities.
• 
Consider and analyze thousands or millions of transactions.
Some auditors and consulting firms have developed tools, as part of their fraud detection efforts, that analyze 
journal entries to mitigate management override of the internal control system. These tools identify transactions 
subject to certain attributes that could indicate risk of management override, such as user identification, date of 
entry, and unusual account pairings. 
Evidence of fraud can sometimes be found in e-mail as well. The ability of an organization to capture, maintain, 
and review the communications of any of its employees has led to the detection of numerous frauds in the past 
decade. This is accomplished through the use of strict and regular backup programs that capture data, not with the 
intent of uncovering fraud, but merely as a safeguard in the event that a retrospective search for evidence may be 
necessary. Recent amendments to the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure could affect future policy decisions about 
the retention of backup materials. The benefit of backup for business purposes, compared to a possible obligation to 
provide evidence in discovery, will need to be balanced in an organization’s risk analysis.
As organizations grow and technology needs change, so do the opportunities for fraud. Because all fraud and 
misconduct schemes cannot be fought with the same tools and techniques, the organization periodically will need to 
assess the effectiveness of process controls, anonymous reporting, and internal auditing.  
Documentation of Fraud Detection Techniques
An organization should document the techniques developed and implemented to detect fraud. This includes 
documenting processes used to monitor the performance of fraud detective controls or to indicate when such 
controls are ineffective. Testing procedures conducted to ensure adequate operation of fraud detective controls and 
the test results should also be documented thoroughly.
	
Paramount to this documentation is a detailed description of the elements of the organization’s fraud detection 
techniques, with emphasis placed on the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. Organizations should 
designate and document the individuals and departments responsible for: 
• 
Designing and planning the overall fraud detection process.
• 
Designing specific fraud detection controls.
• 
Implementing specific fraud detection controls.
• 
Monitoring specific fraud detection controls and the overall system of these controls for realization of the  
process objectives.
• 
Receiving and responding to complaints related to possible fraudulent activity.
• 
Investigating reports of fraudulent activity.
• 
Communicating information about suspected and confirmed fraud to appropriate parties.
• 
Periodically assessing and updating the plan for changes in technology, processes, and organization.
Although the organization may want to describe and explain some aspects of its fraud detection techniques to its 
employees, vendors, and stakeholders to promote deterrence, there will be aspects of the plan that the organization 
will want to remain confidential. During the fraud detection development phase, participants should be warned to 


## Page 39

38
keep such information confidential. The board should approve a specific list of individuals who are permitted access 
to the information and define its own level of information access related to fraud detection controls. 
Once the final fraud detection plan is completed, the team should develop a public communication regarding the 
plan and its implementation. Knowledge throughout the organization that a comprehensive fraud detection plan 
exists is, in and of itself, a strong deterrent. By communicating this to employees, vendors, shareholders, and others, 
the organization affirms that it has a fraud detection plan in place and that it takes fraud seriously without revealing 
all the relevant characteristics of the organization’s fraud detection techniques. 
Assessing the Organization’s Fraud Detection 
Organizations just beginning to assess their fraud risk management program, as well as those striving to improve 
their fraud risk management program, should conduct overall assessments of their fraud detection techniques. The 
Fraud Detection Scorecard in Appendix G can be used to assess how comprehensive the organization’s detective 
controls are and how well they are working. Organizations periodically should reassess their fraud detection 
techniques to ensure that progress is being made to get to an “all-green” fraud detection status and that no 
elements of fraud detection are deteriorating. Organizations with strong commitments to fraud detection may also 
wish to engage independent outside experts to assess their fraud detection techniques.
Continuous Monitoring of Fraud Detection 
The organization should develop ongoing monitoring and measurements to evaluate, remedy, and continuously 
improve the organization’s fraud detection techniques. If deficiencies are found, management should ensure that 
improvements and corrections are made as soon as possible. Management should institute a follow-up plan to verify 
that corrective or remedial actions have been taken.  
The organization should establish measurement criteria to monitor and improve fraud detection. These measures 
should be provided to the board on an ongoing basis.
Measurable criteria include the:
• 
Number of known fraud schemes committed against the organization.
• 
Number and status of fraud allegations received by the organization that required investigation.
• 
Number of fraud investigations resolved.
• 
Number of employees who have/have not signed the corporate ethics statement.
• 
Number of employees who have/have not completed ethics training sponsored by the organization.
• 
Number of whistleblower allegations received via the organization’s hotline.
• 
Number of allegations that have been raised by other means.
• 
Number of messages supporting ethical behavior delivered to employees by executives.
• 
Number of vendors who have/have not signed the organization’s ethical behavior requirements.
• 
Benchmarks with global fraud surveys, including the type of fraud experienced and average losses.
• 
Number of customers who have signed the organization’s ethical behavior requirements.
• 
Number of fraud audits performed by internal auditors.


## Page 40

39
• 
Results of employee or other stakeholder surveys concerning the integrity or culture of the organization.
• 
Resources used by the organization.
Appropriate measurement techniques will vary by organization based on factors, such as controls in place, fraud 
risks identified, and resources available. Examples of specific measurement techniques are:
• 
The recurrence of frauds uncovered.
• 
The timeliness of implementation of remediation plans.
• 
Timeliness in implementing additional controls to prevent new frauds.
• 
Assessment of the likelihood that frauds perpetrated against other organizations in the same industry will 
occur in the organization.
• 
Comparison of fraud versus complaints, grievances, etc., via hotline calls.
• 
Comparison of the number of frauds discovered versus the number of fraud audits performed.
• 
Ratios of problems revealed in background checks versus the number of checks performed.
A senior member of management should be assigned as the process owner for each technique implemented. Each 
process owner should:
• 
Evaluate the effectiveness of the technique regularly.
• 
Adjust the technique as required.
• 
Document any adjustments.
• 
Report immediately through the appropriate channels details of any modification necessary or any 
technique that becomes less effective.
SECTION 5: fraud INVESTIGATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTION
Principle 5: A reporting process should be in place to solicit input on potential fraud, and a coordinated 
approach to investigation and corrective action should be used to help ensure potential fraud is 
addressed appropriately and timely.
It is essential that any violations, deviations, or other breaches of the code of conduct or controls, regardless 
of where in the organization, or by whom, they are committed, be reported and dealt with in a timely manner. 
Appropriate punishment must be imposed, and suitable remediation completed. The board should ensure that the 
same rules are applied at all levels of the organization, including senior management. 
Fraud Investigation and Response Protocols
Receiving the Allegation
Potential fraud may come to the organization’s attention in many ways, including tips from employees, customers, or 
vendors; internal audits; process control identification; external audits; or by accident. The board should ensure that 
the organization develops a system for prompt, competent, and confidential review, investigation, and resolution of 
allegations involving potential fraud or misconduct. Protocols for the board’s involvement in such cases — which 


## Page 41

40
will vary depending on the nature, potential impact, and seniority of persons involved — should be defined clearly 
and communicated to management by the board.
The investigation and response system should include a process for:
• 
Categorizing issues.
• 
Confirming the validity of the allegation.
• 
Defining the severity of the allegation.
• 
Escalating the issue or investigation when appropriate.
• 
Referring issues outside the scope of the program.
• 
Conducting the investigation and fact-finding.
• 
Resolving or closing the investigation.
• 
Listing types of information that should be kept confidential.
• 
Defining how the investigation will be documented.
• 
Managing and retaining documents and information.
The process approved by the board should include a tracking or case management system in which all allegations of 
fraud are logged. Designated senior management approved by the board and the board itself may be given access 
to this system if necessary to ensure that appropriate action is being taken.
Evaluating the Allegation
Once an allegation is received, the organization should follow the process approved by the board to evaluate the 
allegation. The process should include designating an individual or individuals with the necessary authority and 
skills to conduct an initial evaluation of the allegation and determine the appropriate course of action to resolve it. 
In cases that involve the board or senior management, the board may want to hire outside independent advisers to 
assist in this evaluation.
The allegation should be examined to determine whether it involves a potential violation of law, rules, or company 
policy. Depending on the nature and severity of the allegation, other departments may need to be consulted, such as 
HR, legal counsel, senior management, IT, internal auditing, security, or loss prevention. The organization’s external 
auditor must also be advised of any fraud that could affect the organization’s financial statements.
If an allegation involves senior management, or if the allegation affects the financial statements, there may be 
standards, regulations, or laws that require that others (e.g., audit committee, board, external auditors, counsel) be 
notified of the allegation. For example, if the allegation relates to misconduct involving the CEO, the board should  
be notified of the allegation and should ensure that the CEO is not overseeing the investigation.
Investigation Protocols
Investigations should be performed in accordance with protocols approved by the board. A consistent process for  
conducting investigations can help the organization mitigate losses and manage risks associated with the investigation.


## Page 42

41
Factors to consider in developing the investigation plan include:
• 
Time-sensitivity — Investigations may need to be conducted timely due to legal requirements, to mitigate 
losses or potential harm, or to institute an insurance claim.
• 
Notification — Certain allegations may require notification to regulators, law enforcement, insurers, or 
external auditors.
• 
Confidentiality — Information gathered needs to be kept confidential and distribution limited to those with 
an established need.
• 
Legal privileges — Involving legal counsel early in the process or, in some cases, in leading the 
investigation, will help safeguard work product and attorney-client communications.
• 
Compliance — Investigations should comply with applicable laws and rules regarding gathering  
information and interviewing witnesses.
• 
Securing evidence — Evidence should be protected so that it is not destroyed and so that it is admissible in 
legal proceedings.
• 
Objectivity — The investigation team should be removed sufficiently from the issues and individuals under 
investigation to conduct an objective assessment.
• 
Goals — Specific issues or concerns should appropriately influence the focus, scope, and timing of the 
investigation.
Responsibility for overseeing an investigation should be given to an individual with a level of authority at least 
one level higher than anyone potentially involved in the matter. Investigations of allegations involving senior 
management should be overseen by the board or a committee of the board designated for that purpose. Legal 
counsel may be appointed to supervise the investigation.
Depending on the specifics of the allegation, the investigation team may need to include members of different 
departments or disciplines to provide the knowledge and skill sets required. The following resources should be 
considered to determine whether their participation or assistance is necessary:
• 
Legal counsel.
• 
Fraud investigators.
• 
Internal auditors.
• 
External auditors.
• 
Accountants or forensic accountants.
• 
HR personnel.
• 
Security or loss prevention personnel.
• 
IT personnel.
• 
Computer forensics specialists.
• 
Management representative.
The investigation team leader should coordinate the investigation and interface with management as necessary. The 
roles and responsibilities of each team member should be communicated clearly. All team members should consider 
whether there is an actual or potential conflict of interest with any of the issues or parties that could be involved. 
Should the organization not have adequate internal resources and/or if it is determined that internal resources are 
not sufficiently objective, consideration should be given to retaining outside expertise.


## Page 43

42
Conducting the Investigation
Planning is essential to a thorough and competent investigation. The investigation team should establish the 
investigation tasks and assign each task to the appropriate team members. The plan should prioritize the 
performance of tasks to provide an interim report of findings, if necessary, and to revise or plan next steps. It is at 
this stage that appropriate consideration be given to legal issues and constraints in dealing with employees and 
third parties, obtaining relevant information, and documentation, including seeking assistance from the courts and 
monitoring the integrity of the results of the investigation, thereby maximizing the prospects of success.
Investigations generally include many of the following tasks:
1)	 Interviewing, including:
a)	 Neutral third-party witnesses.
b)	 Corroborative witnesses.
c)	 Possible co-conspirators.
d)	 The accused.
2)	 Evidence collection, including:
a)	 Internal documents, such as
i)	
Personnel files.
ii)	 Internal phone records.
iii)	 Computer files and other electronic devices.
iv)	 E-mail.
v)	 Financial records.
vi)	 Security camera videos.
vii)	 Physical and IT system access records.
b)	 External records, such as
i)	
Public records.
ii)	 Customer/vendor information.
iii)	 Media reports.
iv)	 Information held by third parties.
v)	 Private detective reports.
3)	 Computer forensic examinations.
4)	 Evidence analysis, including:
a)	 Review and categorization of information collected.
b)	 Computer-assisted data analysis.
c)	 Development and testing of hypotheses.


## Page 44

43
The investigation team should document and track the steps of the investigation, including:
• 
Items maintained as privileged or confidential.
• 
Requests for documents, electronic data, and other information.
• 
Memoranda of interviews conducted.
• 
Analysis of documents, data, and interviews and conclusions drawn.
Reporting the Results
The investigation team should report its findings to the party overseeing the investigation, such as senior 
management, directors, or legal counsel. Where legal counsel is supervising the investigation, counsel will  
determine the appropriate form of the report. The nature and distribution of the report may be affected by the  
goals of protecting legal privileges and avoiding defamatory statements. For similar reasons, advice of counsel 
should be sought before the party overseeing the investigation makes public statements or other communications 
regarding the investigation.
Corrective Action
After the investigation has been completed, the organization will need to determine what action to take in response 
to the findings. Any findings of actual or potential material impact may need to be reported to the board, the audit 
committee, and the external auditor if they are not receiving investigation reports directly. Notification may also be 
required to legal and regulatory agencies and the organization’s insurers.
In some cases it may be necessary to take certain actions before the investigation is complete (e.g., to preserve 
evidence, maintain confidence, or mitigate losses). This could require suspension or reassignment of individuals  
or legal actions to restrain assets. Those responsible for such decisions should ensure there is a sufficient basis  
for those actions.  
Any action taken should be appropriate under the circumstances, applied consistently to all levels of employees, 
including senior management, and should be taken only after consultation with individuals responsible for such 
decisions. Management consultation with legal counsel is strongly recommended before taking disciplinary, civil,  
or criminal action.
Possible actions include one or more of the following:
• 
Criminal referral — The organization may refer the case to law enforcement voluntarily, and, in some  
cases, it may be required to do so. Law enforcement has access to additional information and resources that 
may aid the case. Additionally, referrals for criminal prosecution may increase the deterrent effect of the 
organization’s fraud prevention policy. An appropriate member of senior management, such as the  
chief legal counsel, should be authorized to make the decision as to whether pursuing criminal prosecution 
is appropriate.
• 
Civil action — The organization may wish to pursue its own civil action against the perpetrators to recover 
funds.
• 
Disciplinary action — Internal disciplinary action may include termination, suspension (with or without 
pay), demotion, or warnings.
• 
Insurance claim — The organization may be able to pursue an insurance claim for some or all of its losses.


## Page 45

44
• 
Extended investigation — Conducting a root cause analysis and performing an extended investigation may 
identify similar misconduct elsewhere in the organization.
• 
Business process remediation — The organization may be able to re-engineer its business processes cost-
effectively to reduce or remove the opportunity for similar frauds in the future.
• 
Internal control remediation — The organization may wish to enhance certain internal controls to reduce 
the risk of similar frauds going undetected in the future.
The organization should consider the potential impact of its response and the message that it may send to the 
public, stakeholders, and others.
Measurement
The scale and complexity of fraud investigations often varies considerably, requiring some flexibility or customization 
for the measurements adopted. Although a variety of measures can be applied, the following may be relatively 
simple and powerful measurements to track: 
• 
Issue resolution time (average number of days to resolve an issue) — This can be measured separately for 
different categories of incident to avoid creating pressure to resolve complex cases in an unrealistically 
short time.
• 
Repeat incidents (number of current period incidents that are similar in nature to incidents in earlier 
periods) — A low rate of repeat incidents can demonstrate effectiveness in promptly and comprehensively 
remedying business processes and internal controls in response to earlier incidents. 
• 
Value of losses recovered and future losses prevented — Fraud investigations are important for their 
deterrent effect, so their cost-effectiveness should not be judged merely by the assets they help to 
recover. However, pursuing asset recoveries vigorously and estimating future losses prevented can help to 
demonstrate the value of fraud risk management actions.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
A proactive approach to managing fraud risk is one of the best steps organizations can take to mitigate exposure 
to fraudulent activities. Although complete elimination of all fraud risk is most likely unachievable or uneconomical, 
organizations can take positive and constructive steps to reduce their exposure. The combination of effective fraud 
risk governance, a thorough fraud risk assessment, strong fraud prevention and detection (including specific anti-
fraud control processes), as well as coordinated and timely investigations and corrective actions, can significantly 
mitigate fraud risks. 
Although fraud is not a subject that any organization wants to deal with, the reality is most organizations 
experience fraud to some degree. The important thing to note is that dealing with fraud can be constructive, and 
forward-thinking, and can position an organization in a leadership role within its industry or business segment. 
Strong, effective, and well-run organizations exist because management takes proactive steps to anticipate issues 
before they occur and to take action to prevent undesired results. Implementation of this guide should help establish 
a climate where positive and constructive steps are taken to protect employees and ensure a positive culture. It 
should be recognized that the dynamics of any organization require an ongoing reassessment of fraud exposures 
and responses in light of the changing environment the organization encounters.

APPENDIX C: SAMPLE FRAUD POLICY41 
NOTE:  This appendix is a sample from another entity. As such, no adjustment has been made to this material.  The 
information may or may not agree with all the concepts noted within this paper. The material is being provided as an 
example that may be a used as a tool, reference, or starting point.
BACKGROUND	 	
The corporate fraud policy is established to facilitate the development of controls that will 
aid in the detection and prevention of fraud against ABC Corporation. It is the intent of 
ABC Corporation to promote consistent organizational behavior by providing guidelines 
and assigning responsibility for the development of controls and conduct of investigations.
SCOPE OF POLICY	
This policy applies to any irregularity, or suspected irregularity, involving employees as well 
as shareholders, consultants, vendors, contractors, outside agencies doing business with 
employees of such agencies, and/or any other parties with a business relationship with 
ABC Corporation (also called the Company). 
 
Any investigative activity required will be conducted without regard to the suspected 
wrongdoer’s length of service, position/title, or relationship to the Company.
POLICY	 	
	
	
Management is responsible for the detection and prevention of fraud, misappropriations, 
and other irregularities. Fraud is defined as the intentional, false representation or 
concealment of a material fact for the purpose of inducing another to act upon it to his 
or her injury. Each member of the management team will be familiar with the types of 
improprieties that might occur within his or her area of responsibility and be alert for any 
indication of irregularity. 
 
Any irregularity that is detected or suspected must be reported immediately to the Director 
of _____________, who coordinates all investigations with the Legal Department and 
other affected areas, both internal and external.
41 This sample is provided by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ Sample Fraud Policy. Please note that other definitions of fraud 
exist, and thus it is important for the organization to explain clearly what types of transactions or activities are covered by the policy.

51
ACTIONS 	
	
	
The terms defalcation, misappropriation, and other fiscal irregularities refer to, but are not
CONSTITUTING 	 	
limited to:
FRAUD  
 
 
• 
Any dishonest or fraudulent act.
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Misappropriation of funds, securities, supplies, or other assets.
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Impropriety in the handling or reporting of money or financial transactions.

Accepting or seeking anything of material value from contractors, vendors, or persons 
providing services/materials to the Company. Exception: Gifts less than US $50 in 
value.
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Destruction, removal, or inappropriate use of records, furniture, fixtures, and 
equipment.
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Any similar or related irregularity.
OTHER IRREGULARITIES	 Irregularities concerning an employee’s moral, ethical, or behavioral conduct should 
by resolved by departmental management and the Employee Relations Unit of Human 
Resources rather than the _________________ Unit.  
 
If there is any question as to whether an action constitutes fraud, contact the Director of 
______________ for guidance.
INVESTIGATION 		
The ____________ Unit has the primary responsibility for the investigation of all
RESPONSIBILITIES 	
suspected fraudulent acts as defined in the policy. If the investigation substantiates that 
fraudulent activities have occurred, the ______________ Unit will issue reports to 
appropriate designated personnel and, if appropriate, to the Board of Directors through 
the Audit Committee. 
 
Decisions to prosecute or refer the examination results to the appropriate law enforcement 
and/or regulatory agencies for independent investigation will be made in conjunction with 
legal counsel and senior management, as will final decisions on disposition of the case.


## Page 53

52
CONFIDENTIALITY	
The ______________ Unit treats all information received confidentially. Any employee 
who suspects dishonest or fraudulent activity will notify the _____________ Unit 
immediately, and should not attempt to personally conduct investigations or interviews/
interrogations related to any suspected fraudulent act (see Reporting Procedures section 
below). 
 
Investigation results will not be disclosed or discussed with anyone other than those 
who have a legitimate need to know. This is important in order to avoid damaging the 
reputations of persons suspected but subsequently found innocent of wrongful conduct 
and to protect the Company from potential civil liability.
AUTHORIZATION FOR 	
Members of the Investigation Unit will have:
INVESTIGATING   
• 
Free and unrestricted access to all Company records and premises, whether
SUSPECTED FRAUD	
	
owned or rented.
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The authority to examine, copy, and/or remove all or any portion of the contents 
of files, desks, cabinets, and other storage facilities on the premises without prior 
knowledge or consent of any individual who might use or have custody of any such 
items or facilities when it is within the scope of their investigation.
REPORTING 		
	
Great care must be taken in the investigation of suspected improprieties or
PROCEDURES	
	
irregularities so as to avoid mistaken accusations or alerting suspected individuals that an 
investigation is under way. 
 
An employee who discovers or suspects fraudulent activity will contact the 
_____________ Unit immediately. The employee or other complainant may remain 
anonymous. All inquiries concerning the activity under investigation from the suspected 
individual, his or her attorney or representative, or any other inquirer should be directed 
to the Investigations Unit or the Legal Department. No information concerning the status 
of an investigation will be given out. The proper response to any inquiries is: “I am not at 
liberty to discuss this matter.” Under no circumstances should any reference be made to 
“the allegation,” “the crime,” “the fraud,” “the forgery,” “the misappropriation,” or any 
other specific reference.

APPENDIX D: FRAUD RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK EXAMPLE
NOTE: This example is for illustrative purposes and focuses solely on potential revenue recognition risks within 
financial reporting. A full fraud risk assessment would consider fraudulent financial reporting in other areas  
relevant to the organization, such as accounts subject to estimation, related-party transactions, and inventory 
accounting. In addition, the risk of misappropriation of assets, corruption, and other misconduct would be  
assessed in the same manner.

1.	
Identified Fraud Risks and Schemes: This column should include a full list of the potential fraud risks and schemes that may 
face the organization. This list will be different for different organizations and should be informed by (a) industry research, (b) 
interviews of employees and other stakeholders, (c) brainstorming sessions, and (d) activity on the whistleblower hotline.
2.	
Likelihood of Occurrence: To design an efficient fraud risk management program, it is important to assess the likelihood of the 
identified fraud risks so that the organization establishes proper anti-fraud controls for the risks that are deemed most likely. 
For purposes of the assessment, it should be adequate to evaluate the likelihood of risks as remote, reasonably possible, and 
probable.
3.	
Significance to the Organization: Quantitative and qualitative factors should be considered when assessing the significance 
of fraud risks to an organization. For example, certain fraud risks may only pose an immaterial direct financial risk to the 
organization, but could greatly impact its reputation, and therefore, would be deemed to be a more significant risk to the 
organization. For purposes of the assessment, it should be adequate to evaluate the significance of risks as immaterial, significant, 
and material.
4.	
People and/or Department Subject to the Risk: As fraud risks are identified and assessed, it is important to evaluate which people 
inside and outside the organization are subject to the risk. This knowledge will assist the organization in tailoring its fraud risk 
response, including establishing appropriate segregation of duties, proper review and approval chains of authority, and proactive 
fraud auditing procedures.
5.	
Existing Anti-fraud Internal Controls: Map pre-existing controls to the relevant fraud risks identified. Note that this occurs after 
fraud risks are identified and assessed for likelihood and significance. By progressing in this order, this framework intends for the 
organization to assess identified fraud risks on an inherent basis, without consideration of internal controls.
6.	
Assessment of Internal Controls Effectiveness: The organization should have a process in place to evaluate whether the identified 
controls are operating effectively and mitigating fraud risks as intended. Companies subject to the provisions of The U.S. Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 will have a process such as this in place. Organizations not subject to Sarbanes-Oxley should 
consider what review and monitoring procedures would be appropriate to implement to gain assurance that their internal control 
structure is operating as intended. 
7.	
Residual Risks: After consideration of the internal control structure, it may be determined that certain fraud risks may not be 
mitigated adequately due to several factors, including (a) properly designed controls are not in place to address certain fraud 
risks or (b) controls identified are not operating effectively. These residual risks should be evaluated by the organization in the 
development of the fraud risk response.
8.	
Fraud Risk Response: Residual risks should be evaluated by the organization and fraud risk responses should be designed to 
address such remaining risk. The fraud risk response could be one or a combination of the following: (a) implementing additional 
controls, (b) designing proactive fraud auditing techniques, and/or (c) reducing the risk by exiting the activity.

Our organizational culture — tone at the top — is as strong as it can possibly be and 
establishes a zero-tolerance environment with respect to fraud.  	
	
Our organization’s top management consistently displays the appropriate attitude 
regarding fraud prevention and encourages free and open communication regarding 
ethical behavior.	
Our Code of Organizational Conduct has specific provisions that address and 
prohibit inappropriate relationships whereby members of our board or members 
of management could use their positions for personal gain or other inappropriate 
purposes.	 	
We have done a rigorous fraud risk assessment using the COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management–Integrated Framework and have taken specific actions to strengthen 
our prevention mechanisms as necessary.	
	
We have assessed fraud risk for our organization adequately based on evaluations 
of similar organizations in our industry, known frauds that have occurred in similar 
organizations, in-house fraud brainstorming, and periodic reassessments of risk.

We have integrated our fraud detection system with our fraud prevention system in a 
cost-effective manner.	
	
Our fraud detection processes and techniques pervade all levels of responsibility 
within our organization, from the board of directors and audit committee, to 
managers at all levels, to employees in all areas of operation.	
	
Our fraud detection policies include communicating to employees, vendors,  
and stakeholders that a strong fraud detection system is in place, but certain  
critical aspects of these systems are not disclosed to maintain the effectiveness  
of hidden controls.	
	
We use mandatory vacation periods or job rotation assignments for employees in key 
finance and accounting control positions.	
	
We periodically reassess our risk assessment criteria as our organization grows and 
changes to make sure we are aware of all possible types of fraud that may occur.	
	
Our fraud detection mechanisms place increased focus on areas in which we have 
concluded that preventive controls are weak or are not cost-effective.	
	
We focus our data analysis and continuous auditing efforts based on our assessment 
of the types of fraud schemes to which organizations like ours (in our industry, or 
with our lines of business) are susceptible.	


## Page 67

66
We take steps to ensure that our detection processes, procedures, and techniques 
remain confidential so that ordinary employees — and potential fraud perpetrators 
— do not become aware of their existence.	
	
We have comprehensive documentation of our fraud detection processes, procedures, 
and techniques so that we maintain our fraud detection vigilance over time and as 
our fraud detection team changes.
	
Our detective controls include a well-publicized and well-managed fraud hotline.	
	
Our fraud hotline program provides anonymity to individuals who report suspected 
wrongdoing.	
	
Our fraud hotline program includes assurances that employees who report suspected 
wrongdoing will not face retaliation. We monitor for retaliation after an issue has 
been reported.	 	
Our fraud hotline has a multilingual capability and provides access to a trained 
interviewer 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.	
	
Our fraud hotline uses a case management system to log all calls and their follow-up 
to resolution, is tested periodically by our internal auditors, and is overseen by the 
audit committee. 	
	
Our fraud hotline program analyzes data received and compares results to norms for 
similar organizations.	
	
Our fraud hotline program is independently evaluated periodically for effectiveness 
and compliance with established protocols.	
	
We use a rigorous system of data analysis and continuous auditing to detect 
fraudulent activity.	
	
Our information systems/IT process controls include controls specifically designed to 
detect fraudulent activity, as well as errors, and include reconciliations, independent 
reviews, physical inspections/counts, analyses, audits, and investigations.
	
	
Our internal audit department’s charter includes emphasis on conducting activities 
designed to detect fraud.	
Our internal auditors participate in the fraud risk assessment process and plan fraud 
detection activities based on the results of this risk assessment.

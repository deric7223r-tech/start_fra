Budget-Holder Fraud Risk Guidance
## Essential Guide for Financial Decision-Makers
 
### Document Purpose
This guide provides practical, actionable fraud risk management guidance for 
budget-holders across all departments. Budget-holders control spending 
decisions and are on the front line of fraud prevention.
 
---
 
## Who Is a Budget-Holder?
 
You are a budget-holder if you:
- Approve purchases or expenditure
- Manage a departmental/project budget
- Authorize supplier payments
- Approve timesheets or expenses
- Make procurement decisions
- Manage contracts with third parties
 
**Your role is critical:** 85% of occupational fraud involves budget-holder 
functions (procurement, payroll, expenses).

## Your Legal & Ethical Obligations
 
### Legal Duties
 
Under the **Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023** 
(effective September 2025):
 
**Organisational Liability:**
If fraud is committed for the organisation's benefit and you failed to prevent it 
through reasonable procedures, the organisation can face:
- Unlimited fines
- Director disqualification
- Criminal conviction
 
**Personal Liability:**
If you knowingly participate in or facilitate fraud:
- Criminal prosecution (Fraud Act 2006)
- Dismissal for gross misconduct
- Civil recovery of losses
- Professional disqualification
 
### Ethical Duties
 


## Page 3

**Stewardship:**
You manage stakeholder resources (taxpayer money, donor funds, shareholder 
capital). This is a position of trust.
 
**Role Modeling:**
Your team watches your behavior. Shortcuts you take signal "acceptable" 
conduct.
 
**Fiduciary Duty:**
Act in the organisation's best interests, not personal convenience.

## Understanding Fraud: The Budget-Holder Perspective
 
### The Fraud Triangle
 
Fraud occurs when three elements align:
 
```
        PRESSURE
    (Financial stress,
     unrealistic targets)
           /\


## Page 4

       /        \
      /          \
     /   FRAUD    \
    /______________\
OPPORTUNITY        RATIONALIZATION
(Weak controls,    ("Everyone does it,"
lack of oversight)  "I deserve this")
```
 
**Your Control Point:** OPPORTUNITY
 
You cannot control employee financial pressures or their ability to rationalize. 
But you CAN remove opportunities through robust controls.

## Common Fraud Scenarios in Budget-Holder Functions
 
### 1. Procurement Fraud
 
#### Scenario A: Fake Supplier Invoice


## Page 5

**How it works:**
- Fraudster creates fake supplier identity
- Submits invoice for goods/services never provided
- Invoice appears legitimate (professional branding, VAT number)
- Payment processed to fraudulent bank account
 
**Red Flags:**
- New supplier with no prior relationship
- Sole trader/individual rather than established company
- Generic email (Gmail, Hotmail vs. corporate domain)
- No physical address or vague location
- Payment urgency ("Pay immediately to avoid penalties")
- Round numbers (£5,000.00 vs. £4,847.23)
 
**Controls:**
- Verify ALL new suppliers before first payment
- Check Companies House registration (UK)
- Call supplier using independently verified phone number
- Require purchase order before invoice submission
- Three quotes for purchases above threshold
 
**Example:**
Finance team received £8,500 invoice from "IT Solutions Ltd" for software 


## Page 6

licenses. Checked Companies House—company dissolved 2 years ago. Avoided 
£8,500 loss.
 
---
 
#### Scenario B: Inflated Pricing / Kickbacks
**How it works:**
- Employee colludes with supplier
- Supplier inflates prices above market rate
- Employee approves payment
- Supplier pays kickback to employee (cash, gifts, benefits)
 
**Red Flags:**
- Single supplier used repeatedly without competitive quotes
- Pricing significantly above market rate
- Employee resistant to changing suppliers
- Unusually close relationship between employee and supplier
- Employee lifestyle inconsistent with salary (luxury items, holidays)
- Split purchases just below approval threshold
 
**Controls:**
- Rotate supplier relationships periodically
- Require competitive quotes for purchases >£X
- Benchmark pricing against market rates


## Page 7

- Segregate duties (requisitioner ≠ approver)
- Declare conflicts of interest (family/friend suppliers)
- Random invoice sampling and price verification
 
**Example:**
Department spent £45,000 annually with one stationery supplier. Market 
comparison showed 40% overpricing. Investigation revealed employee received 
"loyalty rewards" (disguised kickbacks).
 
---
 
#### Scenario C: Split Purchases to Avoid Approval
**How it works:**
- Employee artificially divides one large purchase into multiple smaller 
transactions
- Each transaction falls below approval threshold
- Avoids scrutiny of higher-level authorization
- May be legitimate need or fraud concealment
 
**Red Flags:**
- Multiple invoices from same supplier on same day
- Sequential invoice numbers for similar items
- Purchases just below delegation threshold (e.g., £4,900 when limit is £5,000)
- Vague descriptions ("Miscellaneous supplies")
 


## Page 8

**Controls:**
- Monitor transaction patterns (automated alerts)
- Review supplier spending monthly
- Enforce "no splitting" policy
- Require justification for multiple small purchases
- Approval based on total project cost, not per-invoice
 
---
 
### 2. Invoice & Payment Fraud
 
#### Scenario D: Email Impersonation (Business Email Compromise)
**How it works:**
- Fraudster impersonates supplier via spoofed email
- Email states: "We've changed bank details—please update for future 
payments"
- Looks identical to legitimate supplier communication
- Payment diverted to fraudulent account
- Often timed when key person on leave/unavailable
 
**Red Flags:**
- Unexpected bank detail change request
- Urgency language ("Update immediately")
- Slight misspelling in sender email (supp1ier vs. supplier)


## Page 9

- Generic greeting ("Dear Customer" vs. your name)
- External email warning missing
- Request sent outside normal business hours
 
**Controls:**
- **NEVER update bank details via email alone**
- Call supplier using phone number from contract/invoice (not email)
- Verbal confirmation with two authorized signatories
- Test payment (£1) before full amount
- Flag all bank changes for senior approval
- Email security (SPF, DKIM, DMARC checks)
 
**Example:**
NHS trust received email from "construction supplier" requesting bank change. 
Verified by phone—supplier had not sent email. Avoided £127,000 fraud.
 
**Critical Rule:** All bank detail changes require phone verification using 
independently sourced contact information.
 
---
 
#### Scenario E: Duplicate Payments
**How it works:**
- Same invoice submitted twice (intentionally or accidentally)


## Page 10

- Different invoice numbers or formatting to avoid detection
- Second payment processed
- Fraudster pockets duplicate (if intentional) or supplier retains overpayment
 
**Red Flags:**
- Same amount, same supplier, similar dates
- Supplier unusually slow to notify overpayment
- Vague invoice descriptions making comparison difficult
- Missing purchase order reference
 
**Controls:**
- Three-way match (PO + receipt + invoice)
- Automated duplicate detection (finance system)
- Unique invoice numbering system
- Supplier statement reconciliation monthly
- Payment approval by someone other than requestor
 
---
 
### 3. Payroll & HR Fraud
 
#### Scenario F: Ghost Employees
**How it works:**


## Page 11

- Fictitious employee added to payroll system
- Salary payments made to fraudulent bank account
- Employee "works" in department with poor headcount oversight
- May be former employee not removed from system
 
**Red Flags:**
- Employees with no personnel file
- Same bank account for multiple employees
- Employees never taking leave
- No emergency contact information
- Employee unreachable or never seen in office
- Duplicate National Insurance numbers
 
**Controls:**
- Monthly headcount reconciliation (payroll vs. actual staff)
- Starter/leaver verification by HR and department
- Bank account uniqueness checks
- Mandatory annual leave (fraud detection opportunity)
- Random personnel file audits
 
**Example:**
Council payroll audit found 3 "employees" paid for 18 months. Total loss: 
£87,000. Fraudster was payroll clerk with weak oversight.
 


## Page 12

---
 
#### Scenario G: Timesheet Fraud
**How it works:**
- Employee inflates hours worked
- Unauthorized overtime claimed
- Time claimed for personal activities
- Collusion between employee and timesheet approver
 
**Red Flags:**
- Overtime patterns inconsistent with workload
- Timesheets always submitted at maximum allowed
- Lack of work output despite claimed hours
- Approver doesn't verify actual work performed
- Retrospective timesheet changes
 
**Controls:**
- Require evidence of work completed (deliverables)
- Spot checks on claimed hours vs. building access logs
- Approval by direct supervisor who knows workload
- Pre-authorization required for overtime
- System alerts for unusual patterns
 


## Page 13

---
 
### 4. Expense Fraud
 
#### Scenario H: False Expense Claims
**How it works:**
- Personal expenses claimed as business (meals, travel, accommodation)
- Receipts fabricated or altered (Photoshop, online generators)
- Same receipt submitted multiple times to different approvers
- Expenses for events that didn't occur
 
**Red Flags:**
- Receipts from unusual sources (handwritten, poor quality)
- Mileage claims inconsistent with diary/meetings
- High-value claims with vague descriptions
- Weekend/holiday expenses for "business" activities
- Receipts in employee's name (hotels should show organisation name)
- Sequential receipt numbers across different vendors
 
**Controls:**
- Require original itemized receipts (not credit card slips)
- Cross-check mileage vs. calendar appointments
- Sample verification (call hotel/restaurant to confirm)


## Page 14

- Expense policy with clear examples (what's allowed/prohibited)
- Random audit of expense claims
- Digital receipt submission (harder to alter)
 
**Example:**
Employee claimed £8,000 in "client entertainment" over 6 months. Audit 
revealed receipts from family birthday parties, personal dining. Dismissed for 
gross misconduct.
 
---
 
#### Scenario I: Mileage Fraud
**How it works:**
- Inflated distance claimed
- Personal journeys claimed as business
- Commuting distance included (not reimbursable)
- Phantom journeys (claim travel that didn't occur)
 
**Red Flags:**
- Mileage claims exceed vehicle capacity (e.g., 50,000 miles/year)
- Routes inefficient (Google Maps shows shorter distance)
- Claims for dates when employee was on leave
- Same journey different distances each claim
 


## Page 15

**Controls:**
- Require destination details (address, postcode)
- Automated mileage calculation (system-generated)
- Comparison to calendar/meeting invites
- Spot checks using mapping tools
- Annual declaration of business vs. personal mileage
- Consider company vehicles to eliminate mileage claims
 
---
 
### 5. Contract & Revenue Fraud
 
#### Scenario J: Contract Splitting
**How it works:**
- Large contract artificially divided into smaller contracts
- Each below competitive tender threshold
- Avoids procurement scrutiny
- May involve kickbacks from supplier
 
**Red Flags:**
- Multiple small contracts with same supplier for similar services
- Contracts start/end on consecutive dates
- Total value would exceed tender threshold


## Page 16

- Services could reasonably be consolidated
 
**Controls:**
- Aggregate spending review per supplier annually
- Contracts board review all awards (even below threshold)
- Require business justification for multiple contracts
- Procurement oversight of contract patterns
 
---
 
#### Scenario K: Revenue Manipulation
**How it works:**
- Cash receipts pocketed before recording
- Sales recorded at inflated values
- Revenue recognized prematurely
- Refunds processed to fraudster's account
 
**Red Flags:**
- Unexplained revenue variances
- Cash handling by single individual
- Missing receipt numbers (sequential gaps)
- Refunds processed without supporting evidence
- Customer complaints about missing receipts


## Page 17

 
**Controls:**
- Dual control over cash handling
- Pre-numbered receipt books (gap analysis)
- Daily cash reconciliation
- Refund approval by manager
- Surprise cash counts
- Segregation of duties (cash handler ≠ reconciler)
 
---

- [ ] Benchmark key costs against market/budget
- [ ] Reconcile headcount to payroll
- [ ] Review exception reports (split purchases, high-value transactions)
- [ ] Assess control effectiveness (are processes working?)

---
 
### Annual Responsibilities
 
- [ ] Complete fraud risk assessment for your budget area
- [ ] Review and update financial policies/procedures


## Page 20

- [ ] Mandatory fraud awareness training
- [ ] Declare conflicts of interest
- [ ] Rotate duties/responsibilities (prevent over-familiarity)
 
---
 
## Delegation of Authority: Know Your Limits
 
### Why Authority Limits Matter
 
Delegation limits exist to:
- Prevent single-person fraud
- Ensure appropriate oversight
- Protect you from unwitting involvement in fraud
- Spread accountability
 
### Common Authority Structures
 
**Example Authority Matrix:**
 
| Transaction Type | Up to £1,000 | £1,000-£5,000 | £5,000-£25,000 | £25,000+ 
|
|------------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|----------|


## Page 21

| **Procurement** | Team Leader | Budget Holder | Senior Manager | Director + 
CFO |
| **Expenses** | Line Manager | Budget Holder | Director | CEO |
| **Payroll Changes** | HR Officer | HR Manager | HR Director | CEO |
| **Contract Awards** | N/A | Budget Holder | Director + Procurement | Board |
| **New Suppliers** | N/A | Budget Holder (verified) | Senior Manager | CFO |
 
**Golden Rules:**
1. Never exceed your authority (even "just this once")
2. Never approve your own transactions
3. Never approve for family/friends without disclosure
4. If in doubt, escalate upward
 
---
 
## Spotting Red Flags: Your Fraud Radar
 
### Behavioral Red Flags (People)
 
Watch for changes in behavior:
 
**Financial Stress Indicators:**
- Employee discussing money problems
- Debt collector calls to workplace


## Page 22

- Gambling references
- Sudden lifestyle changes (new car, luxury items inconsistent with salary)
 
**Work Behavior Indicators:**
- Reluctance to take leave (fear of discovery)
- Working unusual hours alone
- Defensive when questioned
- Overly close relationships with suppliers/contractors
- Control issues (won't delegate, won't share passwords)
- Unusually helpful in "covering" for colleagues
 
**Attitudinal Indicators:**
- Disgruntlement with employer
- Entitlement mentality ("I'm underpaid, so I deserve this")
- Pressure to meet unrealistic targets
- "Everyone else does it" justifications
 
**Important:** These are indicators, not proof. Do not accuse—report concerns 
through proper channels.
 
---
 
### Transactional Red Flags (Documents)
 


## Page 23

**Invoice Red Flags:**
- Photocopied invoices (original should be available)
- Handwritten invoices from "established" companies
- Invoice numbers out of sequence
- Dates inconsistent (invoice dated before PO)
- Vague descriptions ("Miscellaneous services")
- Unprofessional formatting/typos
- Missing VAT registration (if VAT charged)
- Post office box address only
 
**Payment Red Flags:**
- Payee name doesn't match supplier
- Payment to individual for corporate service
- Offshore bank accounts (when not expected)
- Round numbers (£10,000.00 vs. £9,847.50)
- Urgency demands ("Pay today or face penalties")
 
**Supplier Red Flags:**
- No online presence (website, Companies House, reviews)
- Contact details generic (mobile phone, Gmail)
- Address is residential or non-existent
- Company name very similar to established firm
- Recently incorporated (check formation date)


## Page 24

 
---
 
## What to Do If You Suspect Fraud
 
### Step 1: Do Not Confront the Individual
 
**Why?**
- Fraudster may destroy evidence
- May pose personal safety risk
- May intimidate witnesses
- Could constitute defamation if wrong
 
**Instead:**
- Document your concerns objectively
- Secure evidence (take copies, don't remove originals)
- Report through proper channels
 
---
 
### Step 2: Report Through Proper Channels
 
**Internal Reporting Options:**


## Page 25

 
1. **Line Manager/Senior Manager**
   Best for: Concerns about subordinates or peers
 
2. **Fraud Risk Owner** (typically CFO, Head of Finance, Head of Governance)
   Best for: Concerns about your manager or complex fraud
 
3. **Whistleblowing Hotline/Email**
   Best for: Sensitive concerns, desire for anonymity
   [Insert your organisation's whistleblowing contact details]
 
4. **Internal Audit**
   Best for: Systemic control weaknesses
 
5. **HR Department**
   Best for: Concerns about employment fraud (timesheets, expenses)
 
**External Reporting Options (if internal channels ineffective):**
 
- **Serious Fraud Office (SFO):** Major/complex fraud
- **Action Fraud (National Fraud & Cyber Crime Reporting Centre):** 0300 123 
2040
- **HMRC:** Tax fraud
- **Charity Commission:** Charity sector fraud


## Page 26

- **NHS Counter Fraud Authority:** NHS fraud
 
---
 
### Step 3: Preserve Evidence
 
**Do:**
- Make copies of suspicious documents
- Save emails (don't delete or forward to personal accounts)
- Note dates, times, people involved
- Write down your observations contemporaneously
- Secure physical evidence (lock in drawer/safe)
 
**Don't:**
- Remove original documents (could be construed as theft)
- Discuss with colleagues (rumors, tipping off fraudster)
- Conduct your own investigation (contaminate evidence)
- Use company IT systems to store evidence (may be accessed by fraudster)
 
---
 
### Step 4: Cooperate with Investigation
 


## Page 27

If an investigation is launched:
 
- **Be available** for interviews
- **Answer honestly** - don't speculate or embellish
- **Maintain confidentiality** - don't discuss with anyone except investigators/
legal counsel
- **Don't retaliate** against whistleblower (even if you disagree with allegation)
- **Follow instructions** from investigators (e.g., don't alert the subject)
 
---
 
## Protection for Whistleblowers
 
### Legal Protections (UK)
 
**Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998** protects you if:
 
- You report in good faith
- You reasonably believe the information is true
- You report to appropriate person/body
- The disclosure is in the public interest
 
**You are protected from:**
- Dismissal


## Page 28

- Disciplinary action
- Demotion or denial of promotion
- Harassment or victimization
 
**Your responsibilities:**
- Report through proper channels first (internal before external)
- Do not make malicious/false allegations
- Do not disclose for personal gain
 
**If you face retaliation:**
Contact [Insert HR/Legal contact] immediately. Retaliation is grounds for 
employment tribunal claim.
 
---
 
## Common Myths About Fraud
 
### Myth 1: "Fraud only happens in large organisations"
 
**Reality:** Small organisations suffer higher fraud losses (as % of revenue) 
due to:
- Fewer resources for controls
- Greater trust/familiarity (less skepticism)
- Lack of segregation of duties


## Page 29

 
### Myth 2: "Trusted, long-serving employees won't commit fraud"
 
**Reality:**
- Average fraudster tenure: 8+ years (ACFE)
- Trust creates opportunity
- Pressure/rationalization can affect anyone
 
### Myth 3: "We have an audit—fraud would be detected"
 
**Reality:**
- Audits sample transactions (don't check 100%)
- Auditors aren't forensic investigators
- Sophisticated fraud designed to pass audit scrutiny
- 15% of fraud detected by external audit vs. 40% by whistleblowing
 
### Myth 4: "Fraud prevention is Finance's job"
 
**Reality:**
- Budget-holders approve 85% of fraud transactions
- YOU are the front line
- Finance provides oversight, but you approve day-to-day spending
 


## Page 30

### Myth 5: "Small amounts don't matter"
 
**Reality:**
- Small frauds escalate (fraudster becomes emboldened)
- Signal weak controls (attracts more fraud)
- £100/week = £5,200/year per fraudster
- Cultural impact ("if they get away with it, why can't I?")
 
---
 
## Training & Awareness
 
### Mandatory Training Requirements
 
All budget-holders must complete:
 
1. **Initial fraud awareness training** (upon appointment)
   - This guidance document
   - Organisation-specific policies
   - Case studies
   - Assessment quiz
 
2. **Annual refresher training**


## Page 31

   - Update on new fraud trends
   - Policy changes
   - Control effectiveness review
 
3. **Specific training for role**
   - Procurement fraud (if managing contracts)
   - Payroll fraud (if approving timesheets)
   - Expense fraud (if approving claims)
 
---
 
### Team Awareness
 
**Your responsibility:** Ensure your team understands:
 
- Fraud risks relevant to their roles
- How to report concerns
- Why controls exist (not "red tape")
- Consequences of fraud (organisational and personal)
 
**Suggested methods:**
- Team meetings (quarterly fraud risk discussion)
- Case study reviews (anonymized)


## Page 32

- Control walkthroughs (explain why we do things)
- "Fraud of the month" email (brief awareness)
 
---
 
## Case Studies: Learn from Real Incidents
 
### Case Study 1: The Trusted Administrator
 
**Background:**
Finance administrator, 12 years' service, highly trusted, never took leave.
 
**Fraud:**
Created fake supplier ("Office Solutions Pro")
Submitted 47 invoices over 3 years for office supplies never delivered
Invoices just below approval threshold (£4,950)
Payments diverted to personal bank account
 
**Total Loss:** £232,650
 
**How Detected:**
Administrator went on sick leave (unexpected)
Temporary cover queried invoice from unfamiliar supplier


## Page 33

Investigation revealed supplier was fake
 
**Controls That Failed:**
- No mandatory annual leave policy
- No supplier verification for amounts below £5,000
- Same person requested and processed payments
- No periodic supplier review
 
**Lessons:**
- Mandatory leave is a control (fraud can't be concealed when absent)
- Verify ALL suppliers, not just large ones
- Segregation of duties prevents single-person fraud
 
---
 
### Case Study 2: The Email Impersonation
 
**Background:**
Finance team received email from "building contractor" working on premises.
 
**Fraud Attempt:**
Email stated: "Our bank has changed. Please update payment details for final 
invoice (£87,000) due this week."
Email looked identical to contractor's format


## Page 34

Sender address: contractor-ltd.com (real company: contractorltd.com - subtle 
difference)
 
**Outcome:**
Finance officer called contractor using phone number from original contract
Contractor confirmed they had NOT changed banks and had not sent email
Payment blocked
Police notified (international fraud gang)
 
**Total Loss:** £0 (prevented)
 
**Controls That Worked:**
- Policy: All bank changes verified by phone
- Used independently sourced contact info (not from email)
- Staff trained to spot impersonation
 
**Lessons:**
- Email is not a secure method for bank changes
- Visual inspection of sender email address critical
- Phone verification using known contact details is gold standard
 
---
 
### Case Study 3: The Split Purchases


## Page 35

 
**Background:**
Department manager had £10,000 single-transaction authority.
 
**Fraud:**
Over 18 months, made 60+ purchases from same IT supplier
Each purchase £9,500-£9,900 (just below threshold)
Total spending: £580,000
Market comparison showed 35% overpricing
 
**Investigation Findings:**
Manager receiving "commission" from supplier (disguised as "consulting fees" 
to shell company)
Supplier inflated prices and paid kickback
Many items never delivered or inferior quality
 
**Total Loss:** £203,000 (overpayments + fictitious goods)
 
**How Detected:**
Finance team ran supplier spend analysis
Flagged concentration risk (single supplier, 60+ transactions)
Internal audit investigation launched
 
**Controls That Failed:**


## Page 36

- No competitive quotes required below £10,000
- No periodic supplier spend review
- Manager not required to declare conflict (consulting relationship)
 
**Lessons:**
- Analyse transaction patterns, not just individual transactions
- Require competitive quotes periodically (even for established suppliers)
- Mandatory conflict of interest declarations annually
 
---

## FAQs for Budget-Holders
 
**Q1: I've approved a payment but now suspect it might be fraudulent. What do 
I do?**
 
A: Report immediately to your manager or fraud risk owner. Do not delay. The 
sooner fraud is detected, the more likely recovery. Do not feel embarrassed—
detecting fraud is a success, not a failure.
 
---
 
**Q2: A supplier is pressuring me to bypass procurement procedures due to 
"urgency." Can I do this?**
 
A: No. Urgency is a common fraud indicator. Legitimate suppliers understand 
proper procedures. Escalate to procurement or senior management if genuinely 
urgent. Document the request and your response.
 
---
 


## Page 39

**Q3: I'm worried about reporting a colleague—we've worked together for 
years.**
 
A: Your duty is to the organisation, not personal relationships. Report concerns; 
let investigators determine facts. Most suspicions are resolved innocently. 
Failing to report is a breach of your responsibilities.
 
---
 
**Q4: How do I balance fraud prevention with trust in my team?**
 
A: Controls are not about distrust—they protect everyone. Fraud controls 
prevent false accusations (evidence trail) and protect honest employees from 
suspicion. Frame controls as protecting the team, not policing them.
 
---
 
**Q5: What if I make a mistake and accidentally approve something I shouldn't?
**
 
A: Honest mistakes happen. Report immediately. Fraud requires intent. If you 
approved in good faith but were deceived, that's fraud by the other party, not 
you. Cooperate with any investigation.
 
---
 
**Q6: Can I approve my own expenses or purchases?**
 


## Page 40

A: No. Self-approval is a fundamental control weakness. All transactions require 
independent approval by someone with appropriate authority.
 
---
 
**Q7: Our budget is tight. Can we skip controls to save time/money?**
 
A: No. Weak controls cost more in fraud losses than they save in efficiency. 
Budget constraints are fraud pressure—controls become MORE important, not 
less.
 
---
 
**Q8: What's the difference between fraud, error, and poor judgment?**
 
A:
- **Fraud:** Intentional deception for personal gain (criminal)
- **Error:** Unintentional mistake (training/process issue)
- **Poor judgment:** Bad decision made honestly (performance issue)
 
Intent is the key. If unsure, report and let investigators determine.

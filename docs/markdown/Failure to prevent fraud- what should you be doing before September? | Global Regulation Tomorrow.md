Failure to prevent fraud: what
should you be doing before
September?

With less than five months to go until the new UK failure to prevent fraud
offence comes into force on 1 September 2025, many organisations are
conducting risk assessments and enhancing anti-fraud policies and
procedures with a view to preventing fraud and providing themselves with
a defence should this be necessary. 
The new offence will apply to organisations wherever they are located
(including outside the UK), where a fraud is committed which has some
nexus to the UK. The only defence for an organisation will be to have
“reasonable procedures” in place to prevent fraud. More details on the
new offence, including the underlying fraud offences covered, are set
out here.
In a recent speech the SFO Director Nick Ephgrave emphasised that the
SFO is looking to prosecute the offence, and noted that organisations

should ensure their procedures are in place by September:
“Come September, if they haven’t sorted themselves out, we’re coming
after them. That’s the message I’ll be delivering…I’m very, very keen to
prosecute someone for that offence. We can’t sit with the statute books
gathering dust, someone needs to feel the bite.”
Whilst, in practice, many organisations will (and should) be continuing to
enhance their policies and procedures on an ongoing basis, it is important
that organisations have taken significant steps ahead of September to
implement “reasonable procedures”, and that there is a clear plan for
further review (and a process for making enhancements, should those be
required) in future.
We will be publishing a series of articles on key steps to take ahead of
September. In this article we explore one of the first steps in preparing for
the new offence: conducting a risk assessment.
Part 1: Risk assessments
As the Home Office’s November 2024 guidance (the HO Guidance) and
UK Finance’s February 2025 guidance (the UKF Guidance) (together the
Guidance) acknowledge, organisations (particularly those in the financial
services and other regulated sectors) may already have existing risk
assessment frameworks in place that can be adapted to address the risks
presented by the new offence.
Our expectation is that conducting a failure to prevent fraud risk
assessment will take some time – the Home Office issued an impact
assessment (see here) in November 2022 which estimated that risk
assessments should take organisations between c.100-130 hours to
prepare.
There are a number of considerations to work through when an


## Page 3

organisation is assessing its approach to risk assessments. We explore
each of these below.
1. Deciding who will conduct and oversee the risk assessment
Jurisdictional scope: the new offence will apply to any organisation and
could arise where a fraud offence is committed with a connection to the
UK (e.g. because a meeting is held or communication is made in the UK)
or where there are victims in the UK (which could include investors and /
or counterparties) or, in some cases, where there is a gain or loss in the
UK. This means that whether an organisation is subject to the offence will
vary depending on the specific circumstances in which the fraud takes
place (and so could shift from transaction to transaction, or as its investor
profile changes). In addition to the jurisdictional scope question,
organisations need to decide whether to approach implementation on a
global or local scale.  -Multinational organisations may choose to conduct
risk assessments and enhance fraud procedures on a global basis
(although in the short term it may make sense to focus efforts on UK
entities and other entities with a UK nexus).
Ownership: it is rare that a single function can effectively conduct the
failure to prevent fraud risk assessment or enhance / implement the
requisite procedures to ensure compliance with the new offence on its
own. Input from stakeholders across the organisation is likely to be
required to fully understand the scenarios in which fraud risks could arise
in practice. We have helped clients put in place cross-functional working
groups to obtain input from a variety of different business units including
finance, marketing, sales, procurement, legal, sustainability,
ethics/compliance and internal audit.
Oversight by senior management: the Guidance suggests it may be
appropriate that some level of approval of the risk assessment should be
given by senior management/the Board and that there should be


## Page 4

designated responsibility for horizon scanning for new fraud risks and
approving the assessment of risk. We would recommend that the
approach taken in conducting a risk assessment is agreed at a senior
level at the outset, with appropriate consideration given to resource
allocation, coordination (e.g. via a working group) and reporting. There
should be a specific budget and resources for undertaking the risk
assessment as well as making relevant enhancements to procedures.
Level of external input: it is worth considering the level of support required
from external  providers to undertake risk assessment(s). Although much
of the knowledge required to conduct the risk assessment will be held
internally, many organisations will need some level of external legal
support including to work through the details of the offences and how they
can be committed in practice, navigating some of the core scoping
questions such as those relating to the definition of associated persons
and questions of territoriality, and benchmarking against peer
organisations.
2. Understanding the relevant risk assessments already in place; and
what they do and do not cover
Most organisations (particularly those in the financial services and other
regulated sectors) have some kind of risk assessment in place that covers
fraud.  Many of these existing risk assessments focus on cases where the
organisation is a victim of fraud (i.e. “inward fraud”) rather than addressing
fraud committed by Associated Persons for the benefit of the organisation
or its clients (i.e. “outward fraud”). Appreciating this distinction is essential
in terms of ensuring the risk assessment is fit for purpose.
3. Assessing the likelihood of the underlying fraud offences arising
It is crucial that those undertaking the risk assessment and enhancing
anti-fraud procedures understand the underlying offences in sufficient


## Page 5

detail. The offences are complex (much more so than, for example, those
under the UK Bribery Act) and often the precise conduct covered by the
offence is not obvious from the shorthand description set out in the
relevant legislation. Further, there are numerous “grey areas” around
whether certain conduct would meet the relevant standard of dishonesty
(a defining characteristic of nearly all of the underlying offences) which
need to be thought through.
Given these challenges, many clients have found it useful to break down
each offence into its constituent elements and to bring these to life with
examples of how each offence could potentially be committed in practice
in their sector (and, as set out below, in each different business unit or
support function or by their associated persons).
Once the underlying offences are fully understood by those participating in
the risk assessment process, it is then important to assess how they could
arise.
The Guidance suggests as a starting point identifying different types of
Associated Person and then for “nominated risk owners” to consider
circumstances in which those associated person might attempt fraud (and
whether there are particular types of fraud offence, e.g. false accounting
or abuse of position which are more likely to be committed by particular
types of Associated Persons).
A strategy we have seen work well to put structure around this is to have
each business head lead an appropriate discussion about the offences
within their function and this may be facilitated by an internal
questionnaire. The business head can then feed back to the working
group those scenarios which have been identified as risk areas and any
relevant controls. This enables the organisation to build up one document
setting out risk areas across the business for each underlying offence and
will also help to promote consistency across different business lines and


## Page 6

functions.  An element of cross fertilisation with different internal teams
learning from each other’s examples can also be helpful. 
For organisations starting their risk assessments now, it may make sense
to determine, and focus in the first instance on, areas of highest risk in
order to identify priority programme enhancements (see below).
4. Conducting a ”gap analysis” to assess what policies and
procedures are already in place and identify any areas for
enhancement
It is important to understand the extent to which existing policies or
procedures (whether fraud specific or otherwise) can be adapted or
supplemented. Many organisations will already have in place policies,
procedures and controls that can be leveraged (e.g. third-party due
diligence and monitoring processes related to bribery and corruption and
controls around financial reporting and approval of marketing materials).
Many clients have found it useful to identify, in relation to each offence and
the scenarios which have been identified, relevant controls that are in
place. Those controls can then be reviewed to determine whether there
are any “gaps” and to identify where enhancements may be required. An
enhancement and prioritisation plan can then be drawn up based on the
output of this work.  This exercise is also useful in drawing together all the
relevant internal anti-fraud procedures so that there is a central record of
these that could be deployed as part of any defence strategy if needed. 
5. Producing a written risk assessment and agreeing when it will be
reconsidered
Whilst the primary purpose of anti-fraud procedures is, of course, to stop
fraud happening in the first place, it is also crucial that an organisation can
defend itself if allegations of fraud are raised and it is facing a criminal
investigation (or seeking to persuade criminal authorities not to


## Page 7

investigate) or alternatively a regulatory investigation. This means the
organisation’s procedures, including the risk assessment, need to be
documented carefully.
To defend procedures effectively requires contemporaneous
documentation of the decisions made and steps taken in conducting a risk
assessment, including the rationale for those decisions. For example,
where an offence arises in an area of a business which was deprioritised
in light of the risk assessment, following a risk-based approach it will be
important to be able to provide contemporaneous evidence of the rationale
for that decision. This is particularly important where the organisation will
not have finalised its anti-fraud procedures by September.
How often should the risk assessment be refreshed? The guidance states
that the risk assessment should be dynamic and kept under regular
review, either annually or bi-annually. Risk assessments should be
refreshed in the interim as the business (and risks faced by the business)
change – and in light of any fraud issues identified either internally or
where knowledge of peer experience is available.
We are helping various organisations prepare for this change: if you would
like to discuss how we can help, please get in touch.

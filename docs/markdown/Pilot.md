Six-Step FRA Process
Step 1: Context & Scope Definition
Define assessment boundaries and objectives
Identify stakeholders with in-depth knowledge
Establish key decision makers and risk owners
Step 2: Research Known Risks
Conduct data analysis
Review previous audits
Gather sector-specific information


## Page 5

Study enforcement actions and best practice
Step 3: Identify & Categorize Risks
Identify key known and hypothetical fraud risks
Categorize by fraud type (asset misappropriation, fraudulent
financial reporting, corruption, cybersecurity)
Define each risk clearly
Step 4: Risk Owner & Inherent Risk Evaluation
Assign a risk owner with sufficient seniority
Evaluate inherent risk using qualitative or quantitative scales
Assess probability and impact
Consider cost vs. materiality of risk exposure
Step 5: Control/Mitigation & Residual Risk Evaluation
Identify existing controls and mitigations
Evaluate residual risk (risk remaining after controls)
Assess control effectiveness
Step 6: Risk Prioritization
Prioritize residual risks against organizational risk appetite
Focus on highest-risk areas first
Create action plans for mitigation
Fraud Risk Assessment Framework - The Fraud Triangle
When assessing fraud risks, consider three key factors:
Opportunity – Can fraud occur?
Weak controls
Lack of segregation of duties
Poor authorization processes
Inadequate monitoring
Motive – Why might someone commit fraud?


## Page 6

Financial pressures and targets
Performance incentives
Recognition and reward systems
Emergency scenarios
Rationalization – How might someone justify fraud?
Organizational culture and tone from the top
Speak-up culture (or lack thereof)
Management integrity
Key Risk Areas to Assess
Process Risks:
Procurement and supplier management
Financial transactions and approvals
Payroll and HR processes
Cash handling and bank reconciliations
Conflict of interest management
People Risks:
Employee screening and vetting
Third-party and contractor risks
Management oversight
Whistleblowing culture
Gifts, hospitality, and bribery risks
Control Risks:
Segregation of duties
Authorization workflows
IT system access controls
Data security and cybersecurity
Monitoring and detection systems
Audit trails and record-keeping

Governance structures for managing fraud risk
Board/executive oversight requirements
Three-level assurance framework
Process Guidance:
Recommended processes for effective FRA implementation
Integration with organizational risk registers
Stakeholder engagement approach
Product Guidance:
What good quality FRA outputs look like
Fraud Risk Register requirements
Documentation standards
Output: Fraud Risk Register
The final product must include a fully populated Fraud Risk
Register containing:
Specific identified fraud risks
Risk owner for each risk
Inherent risk rating (before controls)
Residual risk rating (after controls)
Mitigating controls
Implementation timeline
Success metrics
Areas of uncertainty
The Register should integrate into organizational risk registers as
appropriate.
GovS-013 Requirements
Organizations should establish:


## Page 8

1. Risk Assessments at Three Levels:
High-level enterprise assessment for the board
Intermediate assessment for departments/functions
Detailed assessments for highest-risk areas
2. Counter Fraud Policies & Procedures:
Regularly reviewed counter fraud policy
Fraud response plan
Conflict of interest policies
Gifts and hospitality controls
3. Proactive Testing & Reporting:
Annual work program to mitigate risks
Outcome-based metrics reporting
4. Organizational Assurance:
Three separate levels of assurance
Operational management oversight
Senior management review
Independent audit
"Failure to Prevent Fraud" Offense Compliance
For ECCTA 2023 compliance, organizations must demonstrate
"reasonable fraud prevention procedures" including:
Risk Assessment Considerations:
Reward and recognition systems that may incentivize fraud
Financial or operating pressures (time pressures, targets,
reporting dates)
Emergency scenarios where fraud risks increase
Inside-out view of employees and third parties
Fraud Prevention Measures:
Risk assessments across the corporate group
Updated training programs


## Page 9

Robust control frameworks
Regular monitoring and review
Best Practice Implementation Timeline
Immediate (Months 1-2):
Map core business areas and processes
Identify high-risk areas
Conduct enterprise-level FRA
Engage senior management
Short-term (Months 3-6):
Conduct detailed FRAs in high-risk areas
Document fraud risk register
Develop mitigation strategies
Implement priority controls
Ongoing (6+ months):
Quarterly risk reviews
Annual comprehensive reassessment
Monitor control effectiveness
Update based on enforcement actions and incidents
Key Success Factors
✓ Leadership Commitment – Clear tone from the top about fraud
prevention importance
✓ Stakeholder Engagement – Involve people with deep
knowledge of operations
✓ Proportionality – Tailor assessments to organization size and
risk profile
✓ Data-Driven – Use actual data, audits, and incident history
✓ Integration – Link FRA with broader risk management and
governance
✓ Documentation – Maintain audit trail for compliance evidence


## Page 10

✓ Regular Review – Update assessments annually or after
significant changes
This comprehensive FRA framework ensures organizations can
demonstrate "reasonable fraud prevention procedures" under UK
law and protect themselves against fraud threats.
